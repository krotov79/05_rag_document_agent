All Rights Reserved.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level\n protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information\n systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for\n many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and\n distributed object management systems, through extension of its\n request methods, error codes and headers [47]. A feature of HTTP is\n the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems\n to be built independently of the data being transferred.\n\nHTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information\n initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol\n referred to as \"HTTP/1.1\", and is an update to RFC 2068 [33].\n\nFielding, et al.

HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global\n information initiative since 1990. The first version of HTTP,\n referred to as HTTP/0.9, was a simple protocol for raw data transfer\n across the Internet. HTTP/1.0, as defined by RFC 1945 [6], improved\n the protocol by allowing messages to be in the format of MIME-like\n messages, containing metainformation about the data transferred and\n modifiers on the request/response semantics. However, HTTP/1.0 does\n not sufficiently take into consideration the effects of hierarchical\n proxies, caching, the need for persistent connections, or virtual\n hosts. In addition, the proliferation of incompletely-implemented\n applications calling themselves \"HTTP/1.0\" has necessitated a\n protocol version change in order for two communicating applications\n to determine each other's true capabilities.\n\nThis specification defines the protocol referred to as \"HTTP/1.1\".\n This protocol includes more stringent requirements than HTTP/1.0 in\n order to ensure reliable implementation of its features.\n\nPractical information systems require more functionality than simple\n retrieval, including search, front-end update, and annotation. HTTP\n allows an open-ended set of methods and headers that indicate the\n purpose of a request [47]. It builds on the discipline of reference\n provided by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [3], as a location\n (URL) [4] or name (URN) [20], for indicating the resource to which a\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 7]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nmethod is to be applied. Messages are passed in a format similar to\n that used by Internet mail [9] as defined by the Multipurpose\n Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) [7].\n\nHTTP is also used as a generic protocol for communication between\n user agents and proxies/gateways to other Internet systems, including\n those supported by the SMTP [16], NNTP [13], FTP [18], Gopher [2],\n and WAIS [10] protocols. In this way, HTTP allows basic hypermedia\n access to resources available from diverse applications.\n\n1.2 Requirements",

Standards Track [Page 8]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nresource\n A network data object or service that can be identified by a URI,\n as defined in section 3.2. Resources may be available in multiple\n representations (e.g. multiple languages, data formats, size, and\n resolutions) or vary in other ways.\n\nentity\n The information transferred as the payload of a request or\n response. An entity consists of metainformation in the form of\n entity-header fields and content in the form of an entity-body, as\n described in section 7.\n\nrepresentation\n An entity included with a response that is subject to content\n negotiation, as described in section 12. There may exist multiple\n representations associated with a particular response status.\n\ncontent negotiation\n The mechanism for selecting the appropriate representation when\n servicing a request, as described in section 12. The\n representation of entities in any response can be negotiated\n (including error responses).\n\nvariant\n A resource may have one, or more than one, representation(s)\n associated with it at any given instant. Each of these\n representations is termed a `varriant'. Use of the term `variant'\n does not necessarily imply that the resource is subject to content\n negotiation.\n\nclient\n A program that establishes connections for the purpose of sending\n requests.\n\nuser agent\n The client which initiates a request. These are often browsers,\n editors, spiders (web-traversing robots), or other end user tools.\n\nserver\n An application program that accepts connections in order to\n service requests by sending back responses. Any given program may\n be capable of being both a client and a server; our use of these\n terms refers only to the role being performed by the program for a\n particular connection, rather than to the program's capabilities\n in general. Likewise, any server may act as an origin server,\n proxy, gateway, or tunnel, switching behavior based on the nature\n of each request.\n\nFielding, et al.

A proxy MUST implement\n both the client and server requirements of this specification. A\n \"transparent proxy\" is a proxy that does not modify the request or\n response beyond what is required for proxy authentication and\n identification. A \"non-transparent proxy\" is a proxy that modifies\n the request or response in order to provide some added service to\n the user agent, such as group annotation services, media type\n transformation, protocol reduction, or anonymity filtering. Except\n where either transparent or non-transparent behavior is explicitly\n stated, the HTTP proxy requirements apply to both types of\n proxies.\n\ngateway\n A server which acts as an intermediary for some other server.\n Unlike a proxy, a gateway receives requests as if it were the\n origin server for the requested resource; the requesting client\n may not be aware that it is communicating with a gateway.\n\ntunnel\n An intermediary program which is acting as a blind relay between\n two connections. Once active, a tunnel is not considered a party\n to the HTTP communication, though the tunnel may have been\n initiated by an HTTP request. The tunnel ceases to exist when both\n ends of the relayed connections are closed.\n\ncache\n A program's local store of response messages and the subsystem\n that controls its message storage, retrieval, and deletion. A\n cache stores cacheable responses in order to reduce the response\n time and network bandwidth consumption on future, equivalent\n requests. Any client or server may include a cache, though a cache\n cannot be used by a server that is acting as a tunnel.\n\ncacheable\n A response is cacheable if a cache is allowed to store a copy of\n the response message for use in answering subsequent requests. The\n rules for determining the cacheability of HTTP responses are\n defined in section 13. Even if a resource is cacheable, there may\n be additional constraints on whether a cache can use the cached\n copy for a particular request.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 10]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nfirst-hand\n A response is first-hand if it comes directly and without\n unnecessary delay from the origin server, perhaps via one or more\n proxies. A response is also first-hand if its validity has just\n been checked directly with the origin server.\n\nexplicit expiration time\n The time at which the origin server intends that an entity should\n no longer be returned by a cache without further validation.\n\nheuristic expiration time\n An expiration time assigned by a cache when no explicit expiration\n time is available.\n\nage\n The age of a response is the time since it was sent by, or\n successfully validated with, the origin server.\n\nfreshness lifetime\n The length of time between the generation of a response and its\n expiration time.\n\nfresh\n A response is fresh if its age has not yet exceeded its freshness\n lifetime.\n\nstale\n A response is stale if its age has passed its freshness lifetime.",

A client sends a\n request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and\n protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request\n modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a\n connection with a server. The server responds with a status line,\n including the message's protocol version and a success or error code,\n followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity\n metainformation, and possible entity-body content. The relationship\n between HTTP and MIME is described in appendix 19.4.\n\nMost HTTP communication is initiated by a user agent and consists of\n a request to be applied to a resource on some origin server. In the\n simplest case, this may be accomplished via a single connection (v)\n between the user agent (UA) and the origin server (O).\n\nrequest chain ------------------------>\n UA -------------------v------------------- O\n <----------------------- response chain\n\nA more complicated situation occurs when one or more intermediaries\n are present in the request/response chain. There are three common\n forms of intermediary: proxy, gateway, and tunnel. A proxy is a\n forwarding agent, receiving requests for a URI in its absolute form,\n rewriting all or part of the message, and forwarding the reformatted\n request toward the server identified by the URI. A gateway is a\n receiving agent, acting as a layer above some other server(s) and, if\n necessary, translating the requests to the underlying server's\n protocol. A tunnel acts as a relay point between two connections\n without changing the messages; tunnels are used when the\n communication needs to pass through an intermediary (such as a\n firewall) even when the intermediary cannot understand the contents\n of the messages.\n\nrequest chain -------------------------------------->\n UA -----v----- A -----v----- B -----v----- C -----v----- O\n <------------------------------------- response chain\n\nThe figure above shows three intermediaries (A, B, and C) between the\n user agent and origin server. A request or response message that\n travels the whole chain will pass through four separate connections.\n This distinction is important because some HTTP communication options\n\nFielding, et al.

Standards Track [Page 12]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nmay apply only to the connection with the nearest, non-tunnel\n neighbor, only to the end-points of the chain, or to all connections\n along the chain. Although the diagram is linear, each participant may\n be engaged in multiple, simultaneous communications. For example, B\n may be receiving requests from many clients other than A, and/or\n forwarding requests to servers other than C, at the same time that it\n is handling A's request.\n\nAny party to the communication which is not acting as a tunnel may\n employ an internal cache for handling requests. The effect of a cache\n is that the request/response chain is shortened if one of the\n participants along the chain has a cached response applicable to that\n request. The following illustrates the resulting chain if B has a\n cached copy of an earlier response from O (via C) for a request which\n has not been cached by UA or A.\n\nrequest chain ---------->\n UA -----v----- A -----v----- B - - - - - - C - - - - - - O\n <--------- response chain\n\nNot all responses are usefully cacheable, and some requests may\n contain modifiers which place special requirements on cache behavior.\n HTTP requirements for cache behavior and cacheable responses are\n defined in section 13.\n\nIn fact, there are a wide variety of architectures and configurations\n of caches and proxies currently being experimented with or deployed\n across the World Wide Web. These systems include national hierarchies\n of proxy caches to save transoceanic bandwidth, systems that\n broadcast or multicast cache entries, organizations that distribute\n subsets of cached data via CD-ROM, and so on. HTTP systems are used\n in corporate intranets over high-bandwidth links, and for access via\n PDAs with low-power radio links and intermittent connectivity. The\n goal of HTTP/1.1 is to support the wide diversity of configurations\n already deployed while introducing protocol constructs that meet the\n needs of those who build web applications that require high\n reliability and, failing that, at least reliable indications of\n failure.\n\nHTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP connections. The\n default port is TCP 80 [19], but other ports can be used. This does\n not preclude HTTP from being implemented on top of any other protocol\n on the Internet, or on other networks. HTTP only presumes a reliable\n transport; any protocol that provides such guarantees can be used;\n the mapping of the HTTP/1.1 request and response structures onto the\n transport data units of the protocol in question is outside the scope\n of this specification.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 13]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nIn HTTP/1.0, most implementations used a new connection for each\n request/response exchange. In HTTP/1.1, a connection may be used for\n one or more request/response exchanges, although connections may be\n closed for a variety of reasons (see section 8.1).\n\n2 Notational Conventions and Generic Grammar\n\n2.1 Augmented BNF\n\nAll of the mechanisms specified in this document are described in\n both prose and an augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) similar to that\n used by RFC 822 [9].

White space is only significant in that\n indentation of continuation lines is used to indicate a rule\n definition that spans more than one line. Certain basic rules are\n in uppercase, such as SP, LWS, HT, CRLF, DIGIT, ALPHA, etc. Angle\n brackets are used within definitions whenever their presence will\n facilitate discerning the use of rule names.\n\n\"literal\"\n Quotation marks surround literal text. Unless stated otherwise,\n the text is case-insensitive.\n\nrule1 | rule2\n Elements separated by a bar (\"|\") are alternatives, e.g., \"yes |\n no\" will accept yes or no.\n\n(rule1 rule2)\n Elements enclosed in parentheses are treated as a single element.\n Thus, \"(elem (foo | bar) elem)\" allows the token sequences \"elem\n foo elem\" and \"elem bar elem\".\n\n*rule\n The character \"*\" preceding an element indicates repetition. The\n full form is \"<n>*<m>element\" indicating at least <n> and at most\n <m> occurrences of element. Default values are 0 and infinity so\n that \"*(element)\" allows any number, including zero; \"1*element\"\n requires at least one; and \"1*2element\" allows one or two.\n\n[rule]\n Square brackets enclose optional elements; \"[foo bar]\" is\n equivalent to \"*1(foo bar)\".\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 14]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nN rule\n Specific repetition: \"<n>(element)\" is equivalent to\n \"<n>*<n>(element)\"; that is, exactly <n> occurrences of (element).\n Thus 2DIGIT is a 2-digit number, and 3ALPHA is a string of three\n alphabetic characters.\n\n#rule\n A construct \"#\" is defined, similar to \"*\", for defining lists of\n elements. The full form is \"<n>#<m>element\" indicating at least\n <n> and at most <m> elements, each separated by one or more commas\n (\",\") and OPTIONAL linear white space (LWS). This makes the usual\n form of lists very easy; a rule such as\n ( *LWS element *( *LWS \",\" *LWS element ))\n can be shown as\n 1#element\n Wherever this construct is used, null elements are allowed, but do\n not contribute to the count of elements present. That is,\n \"(element), , (element) \" is permitted, but counts as only two\n elements. Therefore, where at least one element is required, at\n least one non-null element MUST be present. Default values are 0\n and infinity so that \"#element\" allows any number, including zero;\n \"1#element\" requires at least one; and \"1#2element\" allows one or\n two.\n\n; comment\n A semi-colon, set off some distance to the right of rule text,\n starts a comment that continues to the end of line.

The protocol versioning policy is intended to allow\n the sender to indicate the format of a message and its capacity for\n understanding further HTTP communication, rather than the features\n obtained via that communication. No change is made to the version\n number for the addition of message components which do not affect\n communication behavior or which only add to extensible field values.\n The <minor> number is incremented when the changes made to the\n protocol add features which do not change the general message parsing\n algorithm, but which may add to the message semantics and imply\n additional capabilities of the sender. The <major> number is\n incremented when the format of a message within the protocol is\n changed. See RFC 2145 [36] for a fuller explanation.\n\nFielding, et al.

As far as HTTP is concerned, Uniform Resource Identifiers are\n simply formatted strings which identify--via name, location, or any\n other characteristic--a resource.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 18]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\n3.2.1 General Syntax\n\nURIs in HTTP can be represented in absolute form or relative to some\n known base URI [11], depending upon the context of their use. The two\n forms are differentiated by the fact that absolute URIs always begin\n with a scheme name followed by a colon. For definitive information on\n URL syntax and semantics, see \"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):\n Generic Syntax and Semantics,\" RFC 2396 [42] (which replaces RFCs\n 1738 [4] and RFC 1808 [11]). This specification adopts the\n definitions of \"URI-reference\", \"absoluteURI\", \"relativeURI\", \"port\",\n \"host\",\"abs_path\", \"rel_path\", and \"authority\" from that\n specification.\n\nThe HTTP protocol does not place any a priori limit on the length of\n a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle the URI of any resource they\n serve, and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of unbounded length if they\n provide GET-based forms that could generate such URIs. A server\n SHOULD return 414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a URI is longer\n than the server can handle (see section 10.4.15).",

This section defines the scheme-specific syntax and\n semantics for http URLs.\n\nhttp_URL = \"http:\" \"//\" host [ \":\" port ] [ abs_path [ \"?\" query ]]\n\nIf the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed. The semantics\n are that the identified resource is located at the server listening\n for TCP connections on that port of that host, and the Request-URI\n for the resource is abs_path (section 5.1.2). The use of IP addresses\n in URLs SHOULD be avoided whenever possible (see RFC 1900 [24]).

Standards Track [Page 21]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nThe term \"character set\" is used in this document to refer to a\n method used with one or more tables to convert a sequence of octets\n into a sequence of characters. Note that unconditional conversion in\n the other direction is not required, in that not all characters may\n be available in a given character set and a character set may provide\n more than one sequence of octets to represent a particular character.\n This definition is intended to allow various kinds of character\n encoding, from simple single-table mappings such as US-ASCII to\n complex table switching methods such as those that use ISO-2022's\n techniques. However, the definition associated with a MIME character\n set name MUST fully specify the mapping to be performed from octets\n to characters. In particular, use of external profiling information\n to determine the exact mapping is not permitted.\n\nNote: This use of the term \"character set\" is more commonly\n referred to as a \"character encoding.\" However, since HTTP and\n MIME share the same registry, it is important that the terminology\n also be shared.\n\nHTTP character sets are identified by case-insensitive tokens. The\n complete set of tokens is defined by the IANA Character Set registry\n [19].\n\ncharset = token\n\nAlthough HTTP allows an arbitrary token to be used as a charset\n value, any token that has a predefined value within the IANA\n Character Set registry [19] MUST represent the character set defined\n by that registry. Applications SHOULD limit their use of character\n sets to those defined by the IANA registry.\n\nImplementors should be aware of IETF character set requirements [38]\n [41].\n\n3.4.1 Missing Charset\n\nSome HTTP/1.0 software has interpreted a Content-Type header without\n charset parameter incorrectly to mean \"recipient should guess.\"\n Senders wishing to defeat this behavior MAY include a charset\n parameter even when the charset is ISO-8859-1 and SHOULD do so when\n it is known that it will not confuse the recipient.\n\nUnfortunately, some older HTTP/1.0 clients did not deal properly with\n an explicit charset parameter. HTTP/1.1 recipients MUST respect the\n charset label provided by the sender; and those user agents that have\n a provision to \"guess\" a charset MUST use the charset from the\n\nFielding, et al.

Use of non-registered media types is\n discouraged.\n\n3.7.1 Canonicalization and Text Defaults\n\nInternet media types are registered with a canonical form. An\n entity-body transferred via HTTP messages MUST be represented in the\n appropriate canonical form prior to its transmission except for\n \"text\" types, as defined in the next paragraph.\n\nWhen in canonical form, media subtypes of the \"text\" type use CRLF as\n the text line break. HTTP relaxes this requirement and allows the\n transport of text media with plain CR or LF alone representing a line\n break when it is done consistently for an entire entity-body. HTTP\n applications MUST accept CRLF, bare CR, and bare LF as being\n representative of a line break in text media received via HTTP. In\n addition, if the text is represented in a character set that does not\n use octets 13 and 10 for CR and LF respectively, as is the case for\n some multi-byte character sets, HTTP allows the use of whatever octet\n sequences are defined by that character set to represent the\n equivalent of CR and LF for line breaks. This flexibility regarding\n line breaks applies only to text media in the entity-body; a bare CR\n or LF MUST NOT be substituted for CRLF within any of the HTTP control\n structures (such as header fields and multipart boundaries).\n\nIf an entity-body is encoded with a content-coding, the underlying\n data MUST be in a form defined above prior to being encoded.\n\nThe \"charset\" parameter is used with some media types to define the\n character set (section 3.4) of the data. When no explicit charset\n parameter is provided by the sender, media subtypes of the \"text\"\n type are defined to have a default charset value of \"ISO-8859-1\" when\n received via HTTP. Data in character sets other than \"ISO-8859-1\" or\n its subsets MUST be labeled with an appropriate charset value. See\n section 3.4.1 for compatibility problems.\n\n3.7.2 Multipart Types\n\nMIME provides for a number of \"multipart\" types -- encapsulations of\n one or more entities within a single message-body. All multipart\n types share a common syntax, as defined in section 5.1.1 of RFC 2046\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 27]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\n[40], and MUST include a boundary parameter as part of the media type\n value. The message body is itself a protocol element and MUST\n therefore use only CRLF to represent line breaks between body-parts.\n Unlike in RFC 2046, the epilogue of any multipart message MUST be\n empty; HTTP applications MUST NOT transmit the epilogue (even if the\n original multipart contains an epilogue). These restrictions exist in\n order to preserve the self-delimiting nature of a multipart message-\n body, wherein the \"end\" of the message-body is indicated by the\n ending multipart boundary.\n\nIn general, HTTP treats a multipart message-body no differently than\n any other media type: strictly as payload. The one exception is the\n \"multipart/byteranges\" type (appendix 19.2) when it appears in a 206\n (Partial Content) response, which will be interpreted by some HTTP\n caching mechanisms as described in sections 13.5.4 and 14.16. In all\n other cases, an HTTP user agent SHOULD follow the same or similar\n behavior as a MIME user agent would upon receipt of a multipart type.\n The MIME header fields within each body-part of a multipart message-\n body do not have any significance to HTTP beyond that defined by\n their MIME semantics.",

Most fields using\n product tokens also allow sub-products which form a significant part\n of the application to be listed, separated by white space. By\n convention, the products are listed in order of their significance\n for identifying the application.\n\nproduct = token [\"/\" product-version]\n product-version = token\n\nExamples:\n\nUser-Agent: CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3\n Server: Apache/0.8.4\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 28]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nProduct tokens SHOULD be short and to the point. They MUST NOT be\n used for advertising or other non-essential information. Although any\n token character MAY appear in a product-version, this token SHOULD\n only be used for a version identifier (i.e., successive versions of\n the same product SHOULD only differ in the product-version portion of\n the product value).\n\n3.9 Quality Values\n\nHTTP content negotiation (section 12) uses short \"floating point\"\n numbers to indicate the relative importance (\"weight\") of various\n negotiable parameters. A weight is normalized to a real number in\n the range 0 through 1, where 0 is the minimum and 1 the maximum\n value. If a parameter has a quality value of 0, then content with\n this parameter is `not acceptable' for the client. HTTP/1.1\n applications MUST NOT generate more than three digits after the\n decimal point. User configuration of these values SHOULD also be\n limited in this fashion.\n\nqvalue = ( \"0\" [ \".\" 0*3DIGIT ] )\n | ( \"1\" [ \".\" 0*3(\"0\") ] )\n\n\"Quality values\" is a misnomer, since these values merely represent\n relative degradation in desired quality.\n\n3.10 Language Tags\n\nA language tag identifies a natural language spoken, written, or\n otherwise conveyed by human beings for communication of information\n to other human beings. Computer languages are explicitly excluded.\n HTTP uses language tags within the Accept-Language and Content-\n Language fields.\n\nThe syntax and registry of HTTP language tags is the same as that\n defined by RFC 1766 [1]. In summary, a language tag is composed of 1\n or more parts: A primary language tag and a possibly empty series of\n subtags:\n\nlanguage-tag = primary-tag *( \"-\" subtag )\n primary-tag = 1*8ALPHA\n subtag = 1*8ALPHA\n\nWhite space is not allowed within the tag and all tags are case-\n insensitive.

HTTP/1.1 uses entity tags in the ETag (section\n 14.19), If-Match (section 14.24), If-None-Match (section 14.26), and\n If-Range (section 14.27) header fields. The definition of how they\n are used and compared as cache validators is in section 13.3.3. An\n entity tag consists of an opaque quoted string, possibly prefixed by\n a weakness indicator.\n\nentity-tag = [ weak ] opaque-tag\n weak = \"W/\"\n opaque-tag = quoted-string\n\nA \"strong entity tag\" MAY be shared by two entities of a resource\n only if they are equivalent by octet equality.\n\nA \"weak entity tag,\" indicated by the \"W/\" prefix, MAY be shared by\n two entities of a resource only if the entities are equivalent and\n could be substituted for each other with no significant change in\n semantics. A weak entity tag can only be used for weak comparison.\n\nAn entity tag MUST be unique across all versions of all entities\n associated with a particular resource. A given entity tag value MAY\n be used for entities obtained by requests on different URIs. The use\n of the same entity tag value in conjunction with entities obtained by\n requests on different URIs does not imply the equivalence of those\n entities.\n\n3.12 Range Units\n\nHTTP/1.1 allows a client to request that only part (a range of) the\n response entity be included within the response. HTTP/1.1 uses range\n units in the Range (section 14.35) and Content-Range (section 14.16)\n header fields. An entity can be broken down into subranges according\n to various structural units.\n\nrange-unit = bytes-unit | other-range-unit\n bytes-unit = \"bytes\"\n other-range-unit = token\n\nThe only range unit defined by HTTP/1.1 is \"bytes\". HTTP/1.1\n implementations MAY ignore ranges specified using other units.\n\nFielding, et al.

The field value MAY be preceded by any amount\n of LWS, though a single SP is preferred. Header fields can be\n extended over multiple lines by preceding each extra line with at\n least one SP or HT.

(However, section 3.6 places restrictions on\n when certain transfer-codings may be used.)\n\nThe rules for when a message-body is allowed in a message differ for\n requests and responses.\n\nThe presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the\n inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in\n the request's message-headers. A message-body MUST NOT be included in\n a request if the specification of the request method (section 5.1.1)\n does not allow sending an entity-body in requests. A server SHOULD\n read and forward a message-body on any request; if the request method\n does not include defined semantics for an entity-body, then the\n message-body SHOULD be ignored when handling the request.\n\nFor response messages, whether or not a message-body is included with\n a message is dependent on both the request method and the response\n status code (section 6.1.1). All responses to the HEAD request method\n MUST NOT include a message-body, even though the presence of entity-\n header fields might lead one to believe they do. All 1xx\n (informational), 204 (no content), and 304 (not modified) responses\n MUST NOT include a message-body. All other responses do include a\n message-body, although it MAY be of zero length.\n\n4.4 Message Length\n\nThe transfer-length of a message is the length of the message-body as\n it appears in the message; that is, after any transfer-codings have\n been applied. When a message-body is included with a message, the\n transfer-length of that body is determined by one of the following\n (in order of precedence):\n\n1.Any response message which \"MUST NOT\" include a message-body (such\n as the 1xx, 204, and 304 responses and any response to a HEAD\n request) is always terminated by the first empty line after the\n header fields, regardless of the entity-header fields present in\n the message.\n\n2.If a Transfer-Encoding header field (section 14.41) is present and\n has any value other than \"identity\", then the transfer-length is\n defined by use of the \"chunked\" transfer-coding (section 3.6),\n unless the message is terminated by closing the connection.\n\n3.If a Content-Length header field (section 14.13) is present, its\n decimal value in OCTETs represents both the entity-length and the\n transfer-length. The Content-Length header field MUST NOT be sent\n if these two lengths are different (i.e., if a Transfer-Encoding",

If a message is received with both a\n Transfer-Encoding header field and a Content-Length header field,\n the latter MUST be ignored.\n\n4.If the message uses the media type \"multipart/byteranges\", and the\n ransfer-length is not otherwise specified, then this self-\n elimiting media type defines the transfer-length. This media type\n UST NOT be used unless the sender knows that the recipient can arse\n it; the presence in a request of a Range header with ultiple byte-\n range specifiers from a 1.1 client implies that the lient can parse\n multipart/byteranges responses.\n\nA range header might be forwarded by a 1.0 proxy that does not\n understand multipart/byteranges; in this case the server MUST\n delimit the message using methods defined in items 1,3 or 5 of\n this section.\n\n5.By the server closing the connection.

Standards Track [Page 44]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\n8.1.2 Overall Operation\n\nA significant difference between HTTP/1.1 and earlier versions of\n HTTP is that persistent connections are the default behavior of any\n HTTP connection. That is, unless otherwise indicated, the client\n SHOULD assume that the server will maintain a persistent connection,\n even after error responses from the server.\n\nPersistent connections provide a mechanism by which a client and a\n server can signal the close of a TCP connection. This signaling takes\n place using the Connection header field (section 14.10). Once a close\n has been signaled, the client MUST NOT send any more requests on that\n connection.\n\n8.1.2.1 Negotiation\n\nAn HTTP/1.1 server MAY assume that a HTTP/1.1 client intends to\n maintain a persistent connection unless a Connection header including\n the connection-token \"close\" was sent in the request. If the server\n chooses to close the connection immediately after sending the\n response, it SHOULD send a Connection header including the\n connection-token close.\n\nAn HTTP/1.1 client MAY expect a connection to remain open, but would\n decide to keep it open based on whether the response from a server\n contains a Connection header with the connection-token close. In case\n the client does not want to maintain a connection for more than that\n request, it SHOULD send a Connection header including the\n connection-token close.\n\nIf either the client or the server sends the close token in the\n Connection header, that request becomes the last one for the\n connection.\n\nClients and servers SHOULD NOT assume that a persistent connection is\n maintained for HTTP versions less than 1.1 unless it is explicitly\n signaled. See section 19.6.2 for more information on backward\n compatibility with HTTP/1.0 clients.\n\nIn order to remain persistent, all messages on the connection MUST\n have a self-defined message length (i.e., one not defined by closure\n of the connection), as described in section 4.4.\n\nFielding, et al.

If a client does\n such a retry, it MUST NOT pipeline before it knows the connection is\n persistent. Clients MUST also be prepared to resend their requests if\n the server closes the connection before sending all of the\n corresponding responses.\n\nClients SHOULD NOT pipeline requests using non-idempotent methods or\n non-idempotent sequences of methods (see section 9.1.2). Otherwise, a\n premature termination of the transport connection could lead to\n indeterminate results. A client wishing to send a non-idempotent\n request SHOULD wait to send that request until it has received the\n response status for the previous request.\n\n8.1.3 Proxy Servers\n\nIt is especially important that proxies correctly implement the\n properties of the Connection header field as specified in section\n 14.10.\n\nThe proxy server MUST signal persistent connections separately with\n its clients and the origin servers (or other proxy servers) that it\n connects to. Each persistent connection applies to only one transport\n link.\n\nA proxy server MUST NOT establish a HTTP/1.1 persistent connection\n with an HTTP/1.0 client (but see RFC 2068 [33] for information and\n discussion of the problems with the Keep-Alive header implemented by\n many HTTP/1.0 clients).\n\n8.1.4 Practical Considerations\n\nServers will usually have some time-out value beyond which they will\n no longer maintain an inactive connection. Proxy servers might make\n this a higher value since it is likely that the client will be making\n more connections through the same server. The use of persistent\n connections places no requirements on the length (or existence) of\n this time-out for either the client or the server.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 46]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nWhen a client or server wishes to time-out it SHOULD issue a graceful\n close on the transport connection. Clients and servers SHOULD both\n constantly watch for the other side of the transport close, and\n respond to it as appropriate. If a client or server does not detect\n the other side's close promptly it could cause unnecessary resource\n drain on the network.\n\nA client, server, or proxy MAY close the transport connection at any\n time. For example, a client might have started to send a new request\n at the same time that the server has decided to close the \"idle\"\n connection. From the server's point of view, the connection is being\n closed while it was idle, but from the client's point of view, a\n request is in progress.\n\nThis means that clients, servers, and proxies MUST be able to recover\n from asynchronous close events. Client software SHOULD reopen the\n transport connection and retransmit the aborted sequence of requests\n without user interaction so long as the request sequence is\n idempotent (see section 9.1.2). Non-idempotent methods or sequences\n MUST NOT be automatically retried, although user agents MAY offer a\n human operator the choice of retrying the request(s).

If the client sees an error status, it SHOULD\n immediately cease transmitting the body. If the body is being sent\n using a \"chunked\" encoding (section 3.6), a zero length chunk and\n empty trailer MAY be used to prematurely mark the end of the message.\n If the body was preceded by a Content-Length header, the client MUST\n close the connection.\n\n8.2.3 Use of the 100 (Continue) Status\n\nThe purpose of the 100 (Continue) status (see section 10.1.1) is to\n allow a client that is sending a request message with a request body\n to determine if the origin server is willing to accept the request\n (based on the request headers) before the client sends the request\n body. In some cases, it might either be inappropriate or highly\n inefficient for the client to send the body if the server will reject\n the message without looking at the body.\n\nRequirements for HTTP/1.1 clients:\n\n- If a client will wait for a 100 (Continue) response before\n sending the request body, it MUST send an Expect request-header\n field (section 14.20) with the \"100-continue\" expectation.\n\n- A client MUST NOT send an Expect request-header field (section\n 14.20) with the \"100-continue\" expectation if it does not intend\n to send a request body.\n\nBecause of the presence of older implementations, the protocol allows\n ambiguous situations in which a client may send \"Expect: 100-\n continue\" without receiving either a 417 (Expectation Failed) status\n or a 100 (Continue) status. Therefore, when a client sends this\n header field to an origin server (possibly via a proxy) from which it\n has never seen a 100 (Continue) status, the client SHOULD NOT wait\n for an indefinite period before sending the request body.\n\nRequirements for HTTP/1.1 origin servers:",

This exception, the purpose of which is\n to minimize any client processing delays associated with an\n undeclared wait for 100 (Continue) status, applies only to\n HTTP/1.1 requests, and not to requests with any other HTTP-\n version value.\n\n- An origin server MAY omit a 100 (Continue) response if it has\n already received some or all of the request body for the\n corresponding request.\n\n- An origin server that sends a 100 (Continue) response MUST\n ultimately send a final status code, once the request body is\n received and processed, unless it terminates the transport\n connection prematurely.\n\n- If an origin server receives a request that does not include an\n Expect request-header field with the \"100-continue\" expectation,\n the request includes a request body, and the server responds\n with a final status code before reading the entire request body\n from the transport connection, then the server SHOULD NOT close\n the transport connection until it has read the entire request,\n or until the client closes the connection.

Initialize a variable R to the estimated round-trip time to the\n server (e.g., based on the time it took to establish the\n connection), or to a constant value of 5 seconds if the round-\n trip time is not available.\n\n4. Compute T = R * (2**N), where N is the number of previous\n retries of this request.\n\n5. Wait either for an error response from the server, or for T\n seconds (whichever comes first)\n\n6. If no error response is received, after T seconds transmit the\n body of the request.\n\n7. If client sees that the connection is closed prematurely,\n repeat from step 1 until the request is accepted, an error\n response is received, or the user becomes impatient and\n terminates the retry process.\n\nFielding, et al.

Although\n this set can be expanded, additional methods cannot be assumed to\n share the same semantics for separately extended clients and servers.\n\nThe Host request-header field (section 14.23) MUST accompany all\n HTTP/1.1 requests.\n\n9.1 Safe and Idempotent Methods\n\n9.1.1 Safe Methods\n\nImplementors should be aware that the software represents the user in\n their interactions over the Internet, and should be careful to allow\n the user to be aware of any actions they might take which may have an\n unexpected significance to themselves or others.\n\nIn particular, the convention has been established that the GET and\n HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action\n other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered \"safe\".\n This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT\n and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the\n fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.",

The important\n distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects,\n so therefore cannot be held accountable for them.\n\n9.1.2 Idempotent Methods\n\nMethods can also have the property of \"idempotence\" in that (aside\n from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical\n requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD,\n PUT and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and\n TRACE SHOULD NOT have side effects, and so are inherently idempotent.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 51]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nHowever, it is possible that a sequence of several requests is non-\n idempotent, even if all of the methods executed in that sequence are\n idempotent. (A sequence is idempotent if a single execution of the\n entire sequence always yields a result that is not changed by a\n reexecution of all, or part, of that sequence.) For example, a\n sequence is non-idempotent if its result depends on a value that is\n later modified in the same sequence.\n\nA sequence that never has side effects is idempotent, by definition\n (provided that no concurrent operations are being executed on the\n same set of resources).\n\n9.2 OPTIONS\n\nThe OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the\n communication options available on the request/response chain\n identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to\n determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource,\n or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action\n or initiating a resource retrieval.\n\nResponses to this method are not cacheable.\n\nIf the OPTIONS request includes an entity-body (as indicated by the\n presence of Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding), then the media type\n MUST be indicated by a Content-Type field. Although this\n specification does not define any use for such a body, future\n extensions to HTTP might use the OPTIONS body to make more detailed\n queries on the server. A server that does not support such an\n extension MAY discard the request body.\n\nIf the Request-URI is an asterisk (\"*\"), the OPTIONS request is\n intended to apply to the server in general rather than to a specific\n resource. Since a server's communication options typically depend on\n the resource, the \"*\" request is only useful as a \"ping\" or \"no-op\"\n type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test\n the capabilities of the server. For example, this can be used to test\n a proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or lack thereof).\n\nIf the Request-URI is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies\n only to the options that are available when communicating with that\n resource.\n\nA 200 response SHOULD include any header fields that indicate\n optional features implemented by the server and applicable to that\n resource (e.g., Allow), possibly including extensions not defined by\n this specification.

Content negotiation MAY be used to select\n the appropriate response format. If no response body is included, the\n response MUST include a Content-Length field with a field-value of\n \"0\".\n\nThe Max-Forwards request-header field MAY be used to target a\n specific proxy in the request chain. When a proxy receives an OPTIONS\n request on an absoluteURI for which request forwarding is permitted,\n the proxy MUST check for a Max-Forwards field. If the Max-Forwards\n field-value is zero (\"0\"), the proxy MUST NOT forward the message;\n instead, the proxy SHOULD respond with its own communication options.\n If the Max-Forwards field-value is an integer greater than zero, the\n proxy MUST decrement the field-value when it forwards the request. If\n no Max-Forwards field is present in the request, then the forwarded\n request MUST NOT include a Max-Forwards field.\n\n9.3 GET\n\nThe GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an\n entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers\n to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be\n returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the\n process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process.\n\nThe semantics of the GET method change to a \"conditional GET\" if the\n request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since,\n If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET\n method requests that the entity be transferred only under the\n circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The\n conditional GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network\n usage by allowing cached entities to be refreshed without requiring\n multiple requests or transferring data already held by the client.\n\nThe semantics of the GET method change to a \"partial GET\" if the\n request message includes a Range header field. A partial GET requests\n that only part of the entity be transferred, as described in section\n 14.35. The partial GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary\n network usage by allowing partially-retrieved entities to be\n completed without transferring data already held by the client.\n\nThe response to a GET request is cacheable if and only if it meets\n the requirements for HTTP caching described in section 13.\n\nSee section 15.1.3 for security considerations when used for forms.\n\nFielding, et al.

There is no facility for re-sending a status code from an\n asynchronous operation such as this.\n\nThe 202 response is intentionally non-committal. Its purpose is to\n allow a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a\n batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without\n requiring that the user agent's connection to the server persist\n until the process is completed. The entity returned with this\n response SHOULD include an indication of the request's current status\n and either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate of when the\n user can expect the request to be fulfilled.\n\n10.2.4 203 Non-Authoritative Information\n\nThe returned metainformation in the entity-header is not the\n definitive set as available from the origin server, but is gathered\n from a local or a third-party copy.

These two kinds of\n negotiation are orthogonal and thus may be used separately or in\n combination. One method of combination, referred to as transparent\n negotiation, occurs when a cache uses the agent-driven negotiation\n information provided by the origin server in order to provide\n server-driven negotiation for subsequent requests.\n\n12.1 Server-driven Negotiation\n\nIf the selection of the best representation for a response is made by\n an algorithm located at the server, it is called server-driven\n negotiation. Selection is based on the available representations of\n the response (the dimensions over which it can vary; e.g. language,\n content-coding, etc.) and the contents of particular header fields in\n the request message or on other information pertaining to the request\n (such as the network address of the client).\n\nServer-driven negotiation is advantageous when the algorithm for\n selecting from among the available representations is difficult to\n describe to the user agent, or when the server desires to send its\n \"best guess\" to the client along with the first response (hoping to\n avoid the round-trip delay of a subsequent request if the \"best\n guess\" is good enough for the user). In order to improve the server's\n guess, the user agent MAY include request header fields (Accept,\n Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, etc.) which describe its\n preferences for such a response.\n\nServer-driven negotiation has disadvantages:\n\n1. It is impossible for the server to accurately determine what\n might be \"best\" for any given user, since that would require\n complete knowledge of both the capabilities of the user agent\n and the intended use for the response (e.g., does the user want\n to view it on screen or print it on paper?).\n\n2. Having the user agent describe its capabilities in every\n request can be both very inefficient (given that only a small\n percentage of responses have multiple representations) and a\n potential violation of the user's privacy.\n\n3. It complicates the implementation of an origin server and the\n algorithms for generating responses to a request.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 72]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\n4. It may limit a public cache's ability to use the same response\n for multiple user's requests.\n\nHTTP/1.1 includes the following request-header fields for enabling\n server-driven negotiation through description of user agent\n capabilities and user preferences: Accept (section 14.1), Accept-\n Charset (section 14.2), Accept-Encoding (section 14.3), Accept-\n Language (section 14.4), and User-Agent (section 14.43). However, an\n origin server is not limited to these dimensions and MAY vary the\n response based on any aspect of the request, including information\n outside the request-header fields or within extension header fields\n not defined by this specification.\n\nThe Vary header field can be used to express the parameters the\n server uses to select a representation that is subject to server-\n driven negotiation.

When a cache is supplied with a form of the\n list of available representations of the response (as in agent-driven\n negotiation) and the dimensions of variance are completely understood\n by the cache, then the cache becomes capable of performing server-\n driven negotiation on behalf of the origin server for subsequent\n requests on that resource.\n\nTransparent negotiation has the advantage of distributing the\n negotiation work that would otherwise be required of the origin\n server and also removing the second request delay of agent-driven\n negotiation when the cache is able to correctly guess the right\n response.\n\nThis specification does not define any mechanism for transparent\n negotiation, though it also does not prevent any such mechanism from\n being developed as an extension that could be used within HTTP/1.1.\n\n13 Caching in HTTP\n\nHTTP is typically used for distributed information systems, where\n performance can be improved by the use of response caches.

In some\n cases, a server or client might need to provide explicit directives\n to the HTTP caches. We use the Cache-Control header for this purpose.\n\nThe Cache-Control header allows a client or server to transmit a\n variety of directives in either requests or responses. These\n directives typically override the default caching algorithms. As a\n general rule, if there is any apparent conflict between header\n values, the most restrictive interpretation is applied (that is, the\n one that is most likely to preserve semantic transparency). However,\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 77]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nin some cases, cache-control directives are explicitly specified as\n weakening the approximation of semantic transparency (for example,\n \"max-stale\" or \"public\").\n\nThe cache-control directives are described in detail in section 14.9.\n\n13.1.4 Explicit User Agent Warnings\n\nMany user agents make it possible for users to override the basic\n caching mechanisms. For example, the user agent might allow the user\n to specify that cached entities (even explicitly stale ones) are\n never validated. Or the user agent might habitually add \"Cache-\n Control: max-stale=3600\" to every request. The user agent SHOULD NOT\n default to either non-transparent behavior, or behavior that results\n in abnormally ineffective caching, but MAY be explicitly configured\n to do so by an explicit action of the user.\n\nIf the user has overridden the basic caching mechanisms, the user\n agent SHOULD explicitly indicate to the user whenever this results in\n the display of information that might not meet the server's\n transparency requirements (in particular, if the displayed entity is\n known to be stale). Since the protocol normally allows the user agent\n to determine if responses are stale or not, this indication need only\n be displayed when this actually happens. The indication need not be a\n dialog box; it could be an icon (for example, a picture of a rotting\n fish) or some other indicator.\n\nIf the user has overridden the caching mechanisms in a way that would\n abnormally reduce the effectiveness of caches, the user agent SHOULD\n continually indicate this state to the user (for example, by a\n display of a picture of currency in flames) so that the user does not\n inadvertently consume excess resources or suffer from excessive\n latency.\n\n13.1.5 Exceptions to the Rules and Warnings",

This\n decision ought not be made lightly, but may be necessary for reasons\n of availability or performance, especially when the cache is poorly\n connected to the origin server.

Standards Track [Page 78]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nIt also allows the user agent to take steps to obtain a first-hand or\n fresh response. For this reason, a cache SHOULD NOT return a stale\n response if the client explicitly requests a first-hand or fresh one,\n unless it is impossible to comply for technical or policy reasons.\n\n13.1.6 Client-controlled Behavior\n\nWhile the origin server (and to a lesser extent, intermediate caches,\n by their contribution to the age of a response) are the primary\n source of expiration information, in some cases the client might need\n to control a cache's decision about whether to return a cached\n response without validating it. Clients do this using several\n directives of the Cache-Control header.\n\nA client's request MAY specify the maximum age it is willing to\n accept of an unvalidated response; specifying a value of zero forces\n the cache(s) to revalidate all responses. A client MAY also specify\n the minimum time remaining before a response expires. Both of these\n options increase constraints on the behavior of caches, and so cannot\n further relax the cache's approximation of semantic transparency.\n\nA client MAY also specify that it will accept stale responses, up to\n some maximum amount of staleness. This loosens the constraints on the\n caches, and so might violate the origin server's specified\n constraints on semantic transparency, but might be necessary to\n support disconnected operation, or high availability in the face of\n poor connectivity.\n\n13.2 Expiration Model\n\n13.2.1 Server-Specified Expiration\n\nHTTP caching works best when caches can entirely avoid making\n requests to the origin server. The primary mechanism for avoiding\n requests is for an origin server to provide an explicit expiration\n time in the future, indicating that a response MAY be used to satisfy\n subsequent requests. In other words, a cache can return a fresh\n response without first contacting the server.\n\nOur expectation is that servers will assign future explicit\n expiration times to responses in the belief that the entity is not\n likely to change, in a semantically significant way, before the\n expiration time is reached. This normally preserves semantic\n transparency, as long as the server's expiration times are carefully\n chosen.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 79]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nThe expiration mechanism applies only to responses taken from a cache\n and not to first-hand responses forwarded immediately to the\n requesting client.\n\nIf an origin server wishes to force a semantically transparent cache\n to validate every request, it MAY assign an explicit expiration time\n in the past. This means that the response is always stale, and so the\n cache SHOULD validate it before using it for subsequent requests. See\n section 14.9.4 for a more restrictive way to force revalidation.",

The Age field value\n is the cache's estimate of the amount of time since the response was\n generated or revalidated by the origin server.\n\nIn essence, the Age value is the sum of the time that the response\n has been resident in each of the caches along the path from the\n origin server, plus the amount of time it has been in transit along\n network paths.\n\nWe use the term \"age_value\" to denote the value of the Age header, in\n a form appropriate for arithmetic operations.\n\nA response's age can be calculated in two entirely independent ways:\n\n1. now minus date_value, if the local clock is reasonably well\n synchronized to the origin server's clock.

The age is calculated as\n described in section 13.2.3; this section describes how to calculate\n the freshness lifetime, and to determine if a response has expired.\n In the discussion below, the values can be represented in any form\n appropriate for arithmetic operations.\n\nWe use the term \"expires_value\" to denote the value of the Expires\n header. We use the term \"max_age_value\" to denote an appropriate\n value of the number of seconds carried by the \"max-age\" directive of\n the Cache-Control header in a response (see section 14.9.3).\n\nThe max-age directive takes priority over Expires, so if max-age is\n present in a response, the calculation is simply:\n\nfreshness_lifetime = max_age_value\n\nOtherwise, if Expires is present in the response, the calculation is:\n\nfreshness_lifetime = expires_value - date_value\n\nNote that neither of these calculations is vulnerable to clock skew,\n since all of the information comes from the origin server.\n\nIf none of Expires, Cache-Control: max-age, or Cache-Control: s-\n maxage (see section 14.9.3) appears in the response, and the response\n does not include other restrictions on caching, the cache MAY compute\n a freshness lifetime using a heuristic. The cache MUST attach Warning\n 113 to any response whose age is more than 24 hours if such warning\n has not already been added.\n\nAlso, if the response does have a Last-Modified time, the heuristic\n expiration value SHOULD be no more than some fraction of the interval\n since that time. A typical setting of this fraction might be 10%.\n\nThe calculation to determine if a response has expired is quite\n simple:\n\nresponse_is_fresh = (freshness_lifetime > current_age)\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 83]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\n13.2.5 Disambiguating Expiration Values\n\nBecause expiration values are assigned optimistically, it is possible\n for two caches to contain fresh values for the same resource that are\n different.\n\nIf a client performing a retrieval receives a non-first-hand response\n for a request that was already fresh in its own cache, and the Date\n header in its existing cache entry is newer than the Date on the new\n response, then the client MAY ignore the response. If so, it MAY\n retry the request with a \"Cache-Control: max-age=0\" directive (see\n section 14.9), to force a check with the origin server.\n\nIf a cache has two fresh responses for the same representation with\n different validators, it MUST use the one with the more recent Date\n header. This situation might arise because the cache is pooling\n responses from other caches, or because a client has asked for a\n reload or a revalidation of an apparently fresh cache entry.\n\n13.2.6 Disambiguating Multiple Responses\n\nBecause a client might be receiving responses via multiple paths, so\n that some responses flow through one set of caches and other\n responses flow through a different set of caches, a client might\n receive responses in an order different from that in which the origin\n server sent them. We would like the client to use the most recently\n generated response, even if older responses are still apparently\n fresh.",

We would like the client to use the most recently\n generated response, even if older responses are still apparently\n fresh.\n\nNeither the entity tag nor the expiration value can impose an\n ordering on responses, since it is possible that a later response\n intentionally carries an earlier expiration time. The Date values are\n ordered to a granularity of one second.\n\nWhen a client tries to revalidate a cache entry, and the response it\n receives contains a Date header that appears to be older than the one\n for the existing entry, then the client SHOULD repeat the request\n unconditionally, and include\n\nCache-Control: max-age=0\n\nto force any intermediate caches to validate their copies directly\n with the origin server, or\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nto force any intermediate caches to obtain a new copy from the origin\n server.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 84]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nIf the Date values are equal, then the client MAY use either response\n (or MAY, if it is being extremely prudent, request a new response).\n Servers MUST NOT depend on clients being able to choose\n deterministically between responses generated during the same second,\n if their expiration times overlap.\n\n13.3 Validation Model\n\nWhen a cache has a stale entry that it would like to use as a\n response to a client's request, it first has to check with the origin\n server (or possibly an intermediate cache with a fresh response) to\n see if its cached entry is still usable. We call this \"validating\"\n the cache entry. Since we do not want to have to pay the overhead of\n retransmitting the full response if the cached entry is good, and we\n do not want to pay the overhead of an extra round trip if the cached\n entry is invalid, the HTTP/1.1 protocol supports the use of\n conditional methods.\n\nThe key protocol features for supporting conditional methods are\n those concerned with \"cache validators.\" When an origin server\n generates a full response, it attaches some sort of validator to it,\n which is kept with the cache entry. When a client (user agent or\n proxy cache) makes a conditional request for a resource for which it\n has a cache entry, it includes the associated validator in the\n request.\n\nThe server then checks that validator against the current validator\n for the entity, and, if they match (see section 13.3.3), it responds\n with a special status code (usually, 304 (Not Modified)) and no\n entity-body. Otherwise, it returns a full response (including\n entity-body). Thus, we avoid transmitting the full response if the\n validator matches, and we avoid an extra round trip if it does not\n match.\n\nIn HTTP/1.1, a conditional request looks exactly the same as a normal\n request for the same resource, except that it carries a special\n header (which includes the validator) that implicitly turns the\n method (usually, GET) into a conditional.\n\nThe protocol includes both positive and negative senses of cache-\n validating conditions. That is, it is possible to request either that\n a method be performed if and only if a validator matches or if and\n only if no validators match.\n\nFielding, et al.

Standards Track [Page 85]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nNote: a response that lacks a validator may still be cached, and\n served from cache until it expires, unless this is explicitly\n prohibited by a cache-control directive. However, a cache cannot\n do a conditional retrieval if it does not have a validator for the\n entity, which means it will not be refreshable after it expires.\n\n13.3.1 Last-Modified Dates\n\nThe Last-Modified entity-header field value is often used as a cache\n validator. In simple terms, a cache entry is considered to be valid\n if the entity has not been modified since the Last-Modified value.\n\n13.3.2 Entity Tag Cache Validators\n\nThe ETag response-header field value, an entity tag, provides for an\n \"opaque\" cache validator. This might allow more reliable validation\n in situations where it is inconvenient to store modification dates,\n where the one-second resolution of HTTP date values is not\n sufficient, or where the origin server wishes to avoid certain\n paradoxes that might arise from the use of modification dates.\n\nEntity Tags are described in section 3.11. The headers used with\n entity tags are described in sections 14.19, 14.24, 14.26 and 14.44.\n\n13.3.3 Weak and Strong Validators\n\nSince both origin servers and caches will compare two validators to\n decide if they represent the same or different entities, one normally\n would expect that if the entity (the entity-body or any entity-\n headers) changes in any way, then the associated validator would\n change as well. If this is true, then we call this validator a\n \"strong validator.\"\n\nHowever, there might be cases when a server prefers to change the\n validator only on semantically significant changes, and not when\n insignificant aspects of the entity change. A validator that does not\n always change when the resource changes is a \"weak validator.\"\n\nEntity tags are normally \"strong validators,\" but the protocol\n provides a mechanism to tag an entity tag as \"weak.\" One can think of\n a strong validator as one that changes whenever the bits of an entity\n changes, while a weak value changes whenever the meaning of an entity\n changes. Alternatively, one can think of a strong validator as part\n of an identifier for a specific entity, while a weak validator is\n part of an identifier for a set of semantically equivalent entities.\n\nNote: One example of a strong validator is an integer that is\n incremented in stable storage every time an entity is changed.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 86]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nAn entity's modification time, if represented with one-second\n resolution, could be a weak validator, since it is possible that\n the resource might be modified twice during a single second.\n\nSupport for weak validators is optional. However, weak validators\n allow for more efficient caching of equivalent objects; for\n example, a hit counter on a site is probably good enough if it is\n updated every few days or weeks, and any value during that period\n is likely \"good enough\" to be equivalent.\n\nA \"use\" of a validator is either when a client generates a request\n and includes the validator in a validating header field, or when a\n server compares two validators.",

End-to-end headers in\n responses MUST be stored as part of a cache entry and MUST be\n transmitted in any response formed from a cache entry.\n\n- Hop-by-hop headers, which are meaningful only for a single\n transport-level connection, and are not stored by caches or\n forwarded by proxies.\n\nThe following HTTP/1.1 headers are hop-by-hop headers:\n\n- Connection\n - Keep-Alive\n - Proxy-Authenticate\n - Proxy-Authorization\n - TE\n - Trailers\n - Transfer-Encoding\n - Upgrade\n\nAll other headers defined by HTTP/1.1 are end-to-end headers.\n\nOther hop-by-hop headers MUST be listed in a Connection header,\n (section 14.10) to be introduced into HTTP/1.1 (or later).\n\n13.5.2 Non-modifiable Headers",

However, the cache MUST treat this as a partial\n response. Partial responses MAY be combined as described in section\n 13.5.4; the result might be a full response or might still be\n partial. A cache MUST NOT return a partial response to a client\n without explicitly marking it as such, using the 206 (Partial\n Content) status code. A cache MUST NOT return a partial response\n using a status code of 200 (OK).\n\nIf a cache receives a 5xx response while attempting to revalidate an\n entry, it MAY either forward this response to the requesting client,\n or act as if the server failed to respond. In the latter case, it MAY\n return a previously received response unless the cached entry\n includes the \"must-revalidate\" cache-control directive (see section\n 14.9).\n\n13.9 Side Effects of GET and HEAD\n\nUnless the origin server explicitly prohibits the caching of their\n responses, the application of GET and HEAD methods to any resources\n SHOULD NOT have side effects that would lead to erroneous behavior if\n these responses are taken from a cache. They MAY still have side\n effects, but a cache is not required to consider such side effects in\n its caching decisions. Caches are always expected to observe an\n origin server's explicit restrictions on caching.\n\nWe note one exception to this rule: since some applications have\n traditionally used GETs and HEADs with query URLs (those containing a\n \"?\" in the rel_path part) to perform operations with significant side\n effects, caches MUST NOT treat responses to such URIs as fresh unless\n the server provides an explicit expiration time. This specifically\n means that responses from HTTP/1.0 servers for such URIs SHOULD NOT\n be taken from a cache. See section 9.1.1 for related information.\n\n13.10 Invalidation After Updates or Deletions\n\nThe effect of certain methods performed on a resource at the origin\n server might cause one or more existing cache entries to become non-\n transparently invalid. That is, although they might continue to be\n \"fresh,\" they do not accurately reflect what the origin server would\n return for a new request on that resource.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 97]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nThere is no way for the HTTP protocol to guarantee that all such\n cache entries are marked invalid. For example, the request that\n caused the change at the origin server might not have gone through\n the proxy where a cache entry is stored. However, several rules help\n reduce the likelihood of erroneous behavior.\n\nIn this section, the phrase \"invalidate an entity\" means that the\n cache will either remove all instances of that entity from its\n storage, or will mark these as \"invalid\" and in need of a mandatory\n revalidation before they can be returned in response to a subsequent\n request.\n\nSome HTTP methods MUST cause a cache to invalidate an entity.

If it inserts the new response into cache storage the\n rules in section 13.5.3 apply.\n\nNote: a new response that has an older Date header value than\n existing cached responses is not cacheable.\n\n13.13 History Lists\n\nUser agents often have history mechanisms, such as \"Back\" buttons and\n history lists, which can be used to redisplay an entity retrieved\n earlier in a session.\n\nHistory mechanisms and caches are different. In particular history\n mechanisms SHOULD NOT try to show a semantically transparent view of\n the current state of a resource. Rather, a history mechanism is meant\n to show exactly what the user saw at the time when the resource was\n retrieved.\n\nBy default, an expiration time does not apply to history mechanisms.\n If the entity is still in storage, a history mechanism SHOULD display\n it even if the entity has expired, unless the user has specifically\n configured the agent to refresh expired history documents.\n\nThis is not to be construed to prohibit the history mechanism from\n telling the user that a view might be stale.",

The media-range MAY include media type\n parameters that are applicable to that range.\n\nEach media-range MAY be followed by one or more accept-params,\n beginning with the \"q\" parameter for indicating a relative quality\n factor. The first \"q\" parameter (if any) separates the media-range\n parameter(s) from the accept-params.

Although this prevents any media type parameter named\n \"q\" from being used with a media range, such an event is believed\n to be unlikely given the lack of any \"q\" parameters in the IANA\n media type registry and the rare usage of any media type\n parameters in Accept.

A private (non-shared) cache\n MAY cache the response.\n\nNote: This usage of the word private only controls where the\n response may be cached, and cannot ensure the privacy of the\n message content.\n\nno-cache\n If the no-cache directive does not specify a field-name, then a\n cache MUST NOT use the response to satisfy a subsequent request\n without successful revalidation with the origin server.

However, the\n specified field-name(s) MUST NOT be sent in the response to a\n subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin\n server.

The no-store directive applies to the\n entire message, and MAY be sent either in a response or in a\n request. If sent in a request, a cache MUST NOT store any part of\n either this request or any response to it. If sent in a response,\n a cache MUST NOT store any part of either this response or the\n request that elicited it. This directive applies to both non-\n shared and shared caches. \"MUST NOT store\" in this context means\n that the cache MUST NOT intentionally store the information in\n non-volatile storage, and MUST make a best-effort attempt to\n remove the information from volatile storage as promptly as\n possible after forwarding it.\n\nEven when this directive is associated with a response, users\n might explicitly store such a response outside of the caching\n system (e.g., with a \"Save As\" dialog).

In\n particular, malicious or compromised caches might not recognize or\n obey this directive, and communications networks might be\n vulnerable to eavesdropping.\n\n14.9.3 Modifications of the Basic Expiration Mechanism\n\nThe expiration time of an entity MAY be specified by the origin\n server using the Expires header (see section 14.21). Alternatively,\n it MAY be specified using the max-age directive in a response. When\n the max-age cache-control directive is present in a cached response,\n the response is stale if its current age is greater than the age\n value given (in seconds) at the time of a new request for that\n resource. The max-age directive on a response implies that the\n response is cacheable (i.e., \"public\") unless some other, more\n restrictive cache directive is also present.\n\nIf a response includes both an Expires header and a max-age\n directive, the max-age directive overrides the Expires header, even\n if the Expires header is more restrictive. This rule allows an origin\n server to provide, for a given response, a longer expiration time to\n an HTTP/1.1 (or later) cache than to an HTTP/1.0 cache. This might be\n useful if certain HTTP/1.0 caches improperly calculate ages or\n expiration times, perhaps due to desynchronized clocks.\n\nMany HTTP/1.0 cache implementations will treat an Expires value that\n is less than or equal to the response Date value as being equivalent\n to the Cache-Control response directive \"no-cache\". If an HTTP/1.1\n cache receives such a response, and the response does not include a\n Cache-Control header field, it SHOULD consider the response to be\n non-cacheable in order to retain compatibility with HTTP/1.0 servers.\n\nNote: An origin server might wish to use a relatively new HTTP\n cache control feature, such as the \"private\" directive, on a\n network including older caches that do not understand that\n feature. The origin server will need to combine the new feature\n with an Expires field whose value is less than or equal to the\n Date value. This will prevent older caches from improperly\n caching the response.\n\nFielding, et al.

The s-maxage directive\n also implies the semantics of the proxy-revalidate directive (see\n section 14.9.4), i.e., that the shared cache must not use the\n entry after it becomes stale to respond to a subsequent request\n without first revalidating it with the origin server.

In this way,\n extensions to the cache-control directives can be made without\n requiring changes to the base protocol.\n\nThis extension mechanism depends on an HTTP cache obeying all of the\n cache-control directives defined for its native HTTP-version, obeying\n certain extensions, and ignoring all directives that it does not\n understand.\n\nFor example, consider a hypothetical new response directive called\n community which acts as a modifier to the private directive. We\n define this new directive to mean that, in addition to any non-shared\n cache, any cache which is shared only by members of the community\n named within its value may cache the response. An origin server\n wishing to allow the UCI community to use an otherwise private\n response in their shared cache(s) could do so by including\n\nCache-Control: private, community=\"UCI\"\n\nA cache seeing this header field will act correctly even if the cache\n does not understand the community cache-extension, since it will also\n see and understand the private directive and thus default to the safe\n behavior.\n\nFielding, et al.

It is analogous to the \"Received\" field of\n RFC 822 [9] and is intended to be used for tracking message forwards,\n avoiding request loops, and identifying the protocol capabilities of\n all senders along the request/response chain.\n\nVia = \"Via\" \":\" 1#( received-protocol received-by [ comment ] )\n received-protocol = [ protocol-name \"/\" ] protocol-version\n protocol-name = token\n protocol-version = token\n received-by = ( host [ \":\" port ] ) | pseudonym\n pseudonym = token\n\nThe received-protocol indicates the protocol version of the message\n received by the server or client along each segment of the\n request/response chain. The received-protocol version is appended to\n the Via field value when the message is forwarded so that information\n about the protocol capabilities of upstream applications remains\n visible to all recipients.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 146]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nThe protocol-name is optional if and only if it would be \"HTTP\". The\n received-by field is normally the host and optional port number of a\n recipient server or client that subsequently forwarded the message.\n However, if the real host is considered to be sensitive information,\n it MAY be replaced by a pseudonym. If the port is not given, it MAY\n be assumed to be the default port of the received-protocol.\n\nMultiple Via field values represents each proxy or gateway that has\n forwarded the message. Each recipient MUST append its information\n such that the end result is ordered according to the sequence of\n forwarding applications.\n\nComments MAY be used in the Via header field to identify the software\n of the recipient proxy or gateway, analogous to the User-Agent and\n Server header fields. However, all comments in the Via field are\n optional and MAY be removed by any recipient prior to forwarding the\n message.\n\nFor example, a request message could be sent from an HTTP/1.0 user\n agent to an internal proxy code-named \"fred\", which uses HTTP/1.1 to\n forward the request to a public proxy at nowhere.com, which completes\n the request by forwarding it to the origin server at www.ics.uci.edu.\n The request received by www.ics.uci.edu would then have the following\n Via header field:\n\nVia: 1.0 fred, 1.1 nowhere.com (Apache/1.1)\n\nProxies and gateways used as a portal through a network firewall\n SHOULD NOT, by default, forward the names and ports of hosts within\n the firewall region. This information SHOULD only be propagated if\n explicitly enabled. If not enabled, the received-by host of any host\n behind the firewall SHOULD be replaced by an appropriate pseudonym\n for that host.",

The discussion does not include\n definitive solutions to the problems revealed, though it does make\n some suggestions for reducing security risks.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 150]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\n15.1 Personal Information\n\nHTTP clients are often privy to large amounts of personal information\n (e.g. the user's name, location, mail address, passwords, encryption\n keys, etc.), and SHOULD be very careful to prevent unintentional\n leakage of this information via the HTTP protocol to other sources.\n We very strongly recommend that a convenient interface be provided\n for the user to control dissemination of such information, and that\n designers and implementors be particularly careful in this area.\n History shows that errors in this area often create serious security\n and/or privacy problems and generate highly adverse publicity for the\n implementor's company.\n\n15.1.1 Abuse of Server Log Information\n\nA server is in the position to save personal data about a user's\n requests which might identify their reading patterns or subjects of\n interest. This information is clearly confidential in nature and its\n handling can be constrained by law in certain countries. People using\n the HTTP protocol to provide data are responsible for ensuring that\n such material is not distributed without the permission of any\n individuals that are identifiable by the published results.\n\n15.1.2 Transfer of Sensitive Information\n\nLike any generic data transfer protocol, HTTP cannot regulate the\n content of the data that is transferred, nor is there any a priori\n method of determining the sensitivity of any particular piece of\n information within the context of any given request. Therefore,\n applications SHOULD supply as much control over this information as\n possible to the provider of that information. Four header fields are\n worth special mention in this context: Server, Via, Referer and From.\n\nRevealing the specific software version of the server might allow the\n server machine to become more vulnerable to attacks against software\n that is known to contain security holes. Implementors SHOULD make the\n Server header field a configurable option.\n\nProxies which serve as a portal through a network firewall SHOULD\n take special precautions regarding the transfer of header information\n that identifies the hosts behind the firewall. In particular, they\n SHOULD remove, or replace with sanitized versions, any Via fields\n generated behind the firewall.\n\nThe Referer header allows reading patterns to be studied and reverse\n links drawn. Although it can be very useful, its power can be abused\n if user details are not separated from the information contained in\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 151]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nthe Referer. Even when the personal information has been removed, the\n Referer header might indicate a private document's URI whose\n publication would be inappropriate.\n\nThe information sent in the From field might conflict with the user's\n privacy interests or their site's security policy, and hence it\n SHOULD NOT be transmitted without the user being able to disable,\n enable, and modify the contents of the field. The user MUST be able\n to set the contents of this field within a user preference or\n application defaults configuration.",

For example, a browser client could have a\n toggle switch for browsing openly/anonymously, which would\n respectively enable/disable the sending of Referer and From\n information.\n\nClients SHOULD NOT include a Referer header field in a (non-secure)\n HTTP request if the referring page was transferred with a secure\n protocol.\n\nAuthors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET\n based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will\n cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Many existing\n servers, proxies, and user agents will log the request URI in some\n place where it might be visible to third parties. Servers can use\n POST-based form submission instead\n\n15.1.4 Privacy Issues Connected to Accept Headers\n\nAccept request-headers can reveal information about the user to all\n servers which are accessed. The Accept-Language header in particular\n can reveal information the user would consider to be of a private\n nature, because the understanding of particular languages is often\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 152]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nstrongly correlated to the membership of a particular ethnic group.\n User agents which offer the option to configure the contents of an\n Accept-Language header to be sent in every request are strongly\n encouraged to let the configuration process include a message which\n makes the user aware of the loss of privacy involved.\n\nAn approach that limits the loss of privacy would be for a user agent\n to omit the sending of Accept-Language headers by default, and to ask\n the user whether or not to start sending Accept-Language headers to a\n server if it detects, by looking for any Vary response-header fields\n generated by the server, that such sending could improve the quality\n of service.\n\nElaborate user-customized accept header fields sent in every request,\n in particular if these include quality values, can be used by servers\n as relatively reliable and long-lived user identifiers. Such user\n identifiers would allow content providers to do click-trail tracking,\n and would allow collaborating content providers to match cross-server\n click-trails or form submissions of individual users. Note that for\n many users not behind a proxy, the network address of the host\n running the user agent will also serve as a long-lived user\n identifier. In environments where proxies are used to enhance\n privacy, user agents ought to be conservative in offering accept\n header configuration options to end users. As an extreme privacy\n measure, proxies could filter the accept headers in relayed requests.\n General purpose user agents which provide a high degree of header\n configurability SHOULD warn users about the loss of privacy which can\n be involved.",

If an HTTP server translates\n HTTP URIs directly into file system calls, the server MUST take\n special care not to serve files that were not intended to be\n delivered to HTTP clients. For example, UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and\n other operating systems use \"..\" as a path component to indicate a\n directory level above the current one. On such a system, an HTTP\n server MUST disallow any such construct in the Request-URI if it\n would otherwise allow access to a resource outside those intended to\n be accessible via the HTTP server. Similarly, files intended for\n reference only internally to the server (such as access control\n files, configuration files, and script code) MUST be protected from\n inappropriate retrieval, since they might contain sensitive\n information. Experience has shown that minor bugs in such HTTP server\n implementations have turned into security risks.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 153]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\n15.3 DNS Spoofing\n\nClients using HTTP rely heavily on the Domain Name Service, and are\n thus generally prone to security attacks based on the deliberate\n mis-association of IP addresses and DNS names. Clients need to be\n cautious in assuming the continuing validity of an IP number/DNS name\n association.\n\nIn particular, HTTP clients SHOULD rely on their name resolver for\n confirmation of an IP number/DNS name association, rather than\n caching the result of previous host name lookups. Many platforms\n already can cache host name lookups locally when appropriate, and\n they SHOULD be configured to do so. It is proper for these lookups to\n be cached, however, only when the TTL (Time To Live) information\n reported by the name server makes it likely that the cached\n information will remain useful.\n\nIf HTTP clients cache the results of host name lookups in order to\n achieve a performance improvement, they MUST observe the TTL\n information reported by DNS.\n\nIf HTTP clients do not observe this rule, they could be spoofed when\n a previously-accessed server's IP address changes. As network\n renumbering is expected to become increasingly common [24], the\n possibility of this form of attack will grow. Observing this\n requirement thus reduces this potential security vulnerability.\n\nThis requirement also improves the load-balancing behavior of clients\n for replicated servers using the same DNS name and reduces the\n likelihood of a user's experiencing failure in accessing sites which\n use that strategy.\n\n15.4 Location Headers and Spoofing\n\nIf a single server supports multiple organizations that do not trust\n one another, then it MUST check the values of Location and Content-\n Location headers in responses that are generated under control of\n said organizations to make sure that they do not attempt to\n invalidate resources over which they have no authority.\n\n15.5 Content-Disposition Issues",

Standards Track [Page 154]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\n15.6 Authentication Credentials and Idle Clients\n\nExisting HTTP clients and user agents typically retain authentication\n information indefinitely. HTTP/1.1. does not provide a method for a\n server to direct clients to discard these cached credentials. This is\n a significant defect that requires further extensions to HTTP.\n Circumstances under which credential caching can interfere with the\n application's security model include but are not limited to:\n\n- Clients which have been idle for an extended period following\n which the server might wish to cause the client to reprompt the\n user for credentials.\n\n- Applications which include a session termination indication\n (such as a `logout' or `commit' button on a page) after which\n the server side of the application `knows' that there is no\n further reason for the client to retain the credentials.\n\nThis is currently under separate study. There are a number of work-\n arounds to parts of this problem, and we encourage the use of\n password protection in screen savers, idle time-outs, and other\n methods which mitigate the security problems inherent in this\n problem. In particular, user agents which cache credentials are\n encouraged to provide a readily accessible mechanism for discarding\n cached credentials under user control.\n\n15.7 Proxies and Caching\n\nBy their very nature, HTTP proxies are men-in-the-middle, and\n represent an opportunity for man-in-the-middle attacks. Compromise of\n the systems on which the proxies run can result in serious security\n and privacy problems. Proxies have access to security-related\n information, personal information about individual users and\n organizations, and proprietary information belonging to users and\n content providers. A compromised proxy, or a proxy implemented or\n configured without regard to security and privacy considerations,\n might be used in the commission of a wide range of potential attacks.\n\nProxy operators should protect the systems on which proxies run as\n they would protect any system that contains or transports sensitive\n information. In particular, log information gathered at proxies often\n contains highly sensitive personal information, and/or information\n about organizations. Log information should be carefully guarded, and\n appropriate guidelines for use developed and followed. (Section\n 15.1.1).\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 155]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nCaching proxies provide additional potential vulnerabilities, since\n the contents of the cache represent an attractive target for\n malicious exploitation.

The message/http type can be used to enclose a\n single HTTP request or response message, provided that it obeys the\n MIME restrictions for all \"message\" types regarding line length and\n encodings. The application/http type can be used to enclose a\n pipeline of one or more HTTP request or response messages (not\n intermixed). The following is to be registered with IANA [17].\n\nMedia Type name: message\n Media subtype name: http\n Required parameters: none\n Optional parameters: version, msgtype\n version: The HTTP-Version number of the enclosed message\n (e.g., \"1.1\"). If not present, the version can be\n determined from the first line of the body.\n msgtype: The message type -- \"request\" or \"response\". If not\n present, the type can be determined from the first\n line of the body.\n Encoding considerations: only \"7bit\", \"8bit\", or \"binary\" are\n permitted\n Security considerations: none\n\nMedia Type name: application\n Media subtype name: http\n Required parameters: none\n Optional parameters: version, msgtype\n version: The HTTP-Version number of the enclosed messages\n (e.g., \"1.1\"). If not present, the version can be\n determined from the first line of the body.\n msgtype: The message type -- \"request\" or \"response\". If not\n present, the type can be determined from the first\n line of the body.\n Encoding considerations: HTTP messages enclosed by this type\n are in \"binary\" format; use of an appropriate\n Content-Transfer-Encoding is required when\n transmitted via E-mail.\n Security considerations: none\n\nFielding, et al.

Standards Track [Page 164]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\n19.2 Internet Media Type multipart/byteranges\n\nWhen an HTTP 206 (Partial Content) response message includes the\n content of multiple ranges (a response to a request for multiple\n non-overlapping ranges), these are transmitted as a multipart\n message-body. The media type for this purpose is called\n \"multipart/byteranges\".\n\nThe multipart/byteranges media type includes two or more parts, each\n with its own Content-Type and Content-Range fields. The required\n boundary parameter specifies the boundary string used to separate\n each body-part.\n\nMedia Type name: multipart\n Media subtype name: byteranges\n Required parameters: boundary\n Optional parameters: none\n Encoding considerations: only \"7bit\", \"8bit\", or \"binary\" are\n permitted\n Security considerations: none\n\nFor example:\n\nHTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content\n Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT\n Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT\n Content-type: multipart/byteranges; boundary=THIS_STRING_SEPARATES\n\n--THIS_STRING_SEPARATES\n Content-type: application/pdf\n Content-range: bytes 500-999/8000\n\n...the first range...\n --THIS_STRING_SEPARATES\n Content-type: application/pdf\n Content-range: bytes 7000-7999/8000\n\n...the second range\n --THIS_STRING_SEPARATES--\n\nNotes:\n\n1) Additional CRLFs may precede the first boundary string in the\n entity.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 165]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\n2) Although RFC 2046 [40] permits the boundary string to be\n quoted, some existing implementations handle a quoted boundary\n string incorrectly.\n\n3) A number of browsers and servers were coded to an early draft\n of the byteranges specification to use a media type of\n multipart/x-byteranges, which is almost, but not quite\n compatible with the version documented in HTTP/1.1.\n\n19.3 Tolerant Applications\n\nAlthough this document specifies the requirements for the generation\n of HTTP/1.1 messages, not all applications will be correct in their\n implementation. We therefore recommend that operational applications\n be tolerant of deviations whenever those deviations can be\n interpreted unambiguously.\n\nClients SHOULD be tolerant in parsing the Status-Line and servers\n tolerant when parsing the Request-Line. In particular, they SHOULD\n accept any amount of SP or HT characters between fields, even though\n only a single SP is required.\n\nThe line terminator for message-header fields is the sequence CRLF.\n However, we recommend that applications, when parsing such headers,\n recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore the leading CR.\n\nThe character set of an entity-body SHOULD be labeled as the lowest\n common denominator of the character codes used within that body, with\n the exception that not labeling the entity is preferred over labeling\n the entity with the labels US-ASCII or ISO-8859-1. See section 3.7.1\n and 3.4.1.\n\nAdditional rules for requirements on parsing and encoding of dates\n and other potential problems with date encodings include:",

See section 3.7.1\n and 3.4.1.\n\nAdditional rules for requirements on parsing and encoding of dates\n and other potential problems with date encodings include:\n\n- HTTP/1.1 clients and caches SHOULD assume that an RFC-850 date\n which appears to be more than 50 years in the future is in fact\n in the past (this helps solve the \"year 2000\" problem).\n\n- An HTTP/1.1 implementation MAY internally represent a parsed\n Expires date as earlier than the proper value, but MUST NOT\n internally represent a parsed Expires date as later than the\n proper value.\n\n- All expiration-related calculations MUST be done in GMT. The\n local time zone MUST NOT influence the calculation or comparison\n of an age or expiration time.\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 166]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\n- If an HTTP header incorrectly carries a date value with a time\n zone other than GMT, it MUST be converted into GMT using the\n most conservative possible conversion.\n\n19.4 Differences Between HTTP Entities and RFC 2045 Entities\n\nHTTP/1.1 uses many of the constructs defined for Internet Mail (RFC\n 822 [9]) and the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME [7]) to\n allow entities to be transmitted in an open variety of\n representations and with extensible mechanisms. However, RFC 2045\n discusses mail, and HTTP has a few features that are different from\n those described in RFC 2045. These differences were carefully chosen\n to optimize performance over binary connections, to allow greater\n freedom in the use of new media types, to make date comparisons\n easier, and to acknowledge the practice of some early HTTP servers\n and clients.\n\nThis appendix describes specific areas where HTTP differs from RFC\n 2045. Proxies and gateways to strict MIME environments SHOULD be\n aware of these differences and provide the appropriate conversions\n where necessary. Proxies and gateways from MIME environments to HTTP\n also need to be aware of the differences because some conversions\n might be required.\n\n19.4.1 MIME-Version\n\nHTTP is not a MIME-compliant protocol. However, HTTP/1.1 messages MAY\n include a single MIME-Version general-header field to indicate what\n version of the MIME protocol was used to construct the message. Use\n of the MIME-Version header field indicates that the message is in\n full compliance with the MIME protocol (as defined in RFC 2045[7]).\n Proxies/gateways are responsible for ensuring full compliance (where\n possible) when exporting HTTP messages to strict MIME environments.\n\nMIME-Version = \"MIME-Version\" \":\" 1*DIGIT \".\" 1*DIGIT\n\nMIME version \"1.0\" is the default for use in HTTP/1.1. However,\n HTTP/1.1 message parsing and semantics are defined by this document\n and not the MIME specification.\n\n19.4.2 Conversion to Canonical Form\n\nRFC 2045 [7] requires that an Internet mail entity be converted to\n canonical form prior to being transferred, as described in section 4\n of RFC 2049 [48]. Section 3.7.1 of this document describes the forms\n allowed for subtypes of the \"text\" media type when transmitted over\n HTTP. RFC 2046 requires that content with a type of \"text\" represent\n line breaks as CRLF and forbids the use of CR or LF outside of line",

RFC 2046 requires that content with a type of \"text\" represent\n line breaks as CRLF and forbids the use of CR or LF outside of line\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 167]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nbreak sequences. HTTP allows CRLF, bare CR, and bare LF to indicate a\n line break within text content when a message is transmitted over\n HTTP.\n\nWhere it is possible, a proxy or gateway from HTTP to a strict MIME\n environment SHOULD translate all line breaks within the text media\n types described in section 3.7.1 of this document to the RFC 2049\n canonical form of CRLF. Note, however, that this might be complicated\n by the presence of a Content-Encoding and by the fact that HTTP\n allows the use of some character sets which do not use octets 13 and\n 10 to represent CR and LF, as is the case for some multi-byte\n character sets.\n\nImplementors should note that conversion will break any cryptographic\n checksums applied to the original content unless the original content\n is already in canonical form. Therefore, the canonical form is\n recommended for any content that uses such checksums in HTTP.\n\n19.4.3 Conversion of Date Formats\n\nHTTP/1.1 uses a restricted set of date formats (section 3.3.1) to\n simplify the process of date comparison. Proxies and gateways from\n other protocols SHOULD ensure that any Date header field present in a\n message conforms to one of the HTTP/1.1 formats and rewrite the date\n if necessary.\n\n19.4.4 Introduction of Content-Encoding\n\nRFC 2045 does not include any concept equivalent to HTTP/1.1's\n Content-Encoding header field. Since this acts as a modifier on the\n media type, proxies and gateways from HTTP to MIME-compliant\n protocols MUST either change the value of the Content-Type header\n field or decode the entity-body before forwarding the message.

Implementors are advised to be\n aware of these features, but cannot rely upon their presence in, or\n interoperability with, other HTTP/1.1 applications. Some of these\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 169]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\ndescribe proposed experimental features, and some describe features\n that experimental deployment found lacking that are now addressed in\n the base HTTP/1.1 specification.\n\nA number of other headers, such as Content-Disposition and Title,\n from SMTP and MIME are also often implemented (see RFC 2076 [37]).\n\n19.5.1 Content-Disposition\n\nThe Content-Disposition response-header field has been proposed as a\n means for the origin server to suggest a default filename if the user\n requests that the content is saved to a file. This usage is derived\n from the definition of Content-Disposition in RFC 1806 [35].\n\ncontent-disposition = \"Content-Disposition\" \":\"\n disposition-type *( \";\" disposition-parm )\n disposition-type = \"attachment\" | disp-extension-token\n disposition-parm = filename-parm | disp-extension-parm\n filename-parm = \"filename\" \"=\" quoted-string\n disp-extension-token = token\n disp-extension-parm = token \"=\" ( token | quoted-string )\n\nAn example is\n\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"fname.ext\"\n\nThe receiving user agent SHOULD NOT respect any directory path\n information present in the filename-parm parameter, which is the only\n parameter believed to apply to HTTP implementations at this time. The\n filename SHOULD be treated as a terminal component only.\n\nIf this header is used in a response with the application/octet-\n stream content-type, the implied suggestion is that the user agent\n should not display the response, but directly enter a `save response\n as...' dialog.\n\nSee section 15.5 for Content-Disposition security issues.\n\n19.6 Compatibility with Previous Versions",

HTTP/1.1 was deliberately\n designed, however, to make supporting previous versions easy. It is\n worth noting that, at the time of composing this specification\n (1996), we would expect commercial HTTP/1.1 servers to:\n\n- recognize the format of the Request-Line for HTTP/0.9, 1.0, and\n 1.1 requests;\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 170]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\n- understand any valid request in the format of HTTP/0.9, 1.0, or\n 1.1;\n\n- respond appropriately with a message in the same major version\n used by the client.\n\nAnd we would expect HTTP/1.1 clients to:\n\n- recognize the format of the Status-Line for HTTP/1.0 and 1.1\n responses;\n\n- understand any valid response in the format of HTTP/0.9, 1.0, or\n 1.1.\n\nFor most implementations of HTTP/1.0, each connection is established\n by the client prior to the request and closed by the server after\n sending the response. Some implementations implement the Keep-Alive\n version of persistent connections described in section 19.7.1 of RFC\n 2068 [33].\n\n19.6.1 Changes from HTTP/1.0\n\nThis section summarizes major differences between versions HTTP/1.0\n and HTTP/1.1.\n\n19.6.1.1 Changes to Simplify Multi-homed Web Servers and Conserve IP\n Addresses\n\nThe requirements that clients and servers support the Host request-\n header, report an error if the Host request-header (section 14.23) is\n missing from an HTTP/1.1 request, and accept absolute URIs (section\n 5.1.2) are among the most important changes defined by this\n specification.\n\nOlder HTTP/1.0 clients assumed a one-to-one relationship of IP\n addresses and servers; there was no other established mechanism for\n distinguishing the intended server of a request than the IP address\n to which that request was directed. The changes outlined above will\n allow the Internet, once older HTTP clients are no longer common, to\n support multiple Web sites from a single IP address, greatly\n simplifying large operational Web servers, where allocation of many\n IP addresses to a single host has created serious problems. The\n Internet will also be able to recover the IP addresses that have been\n allocated for the sole purpose of allowing special-purpose domain\n names to be used in root-level HTTP URLs. Given the rate of growth of\n the Web, and the number of servers already deployed, it is extremely\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 171]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nimportant that all implementations of HTTP (including updates to\n existing HTTP/1.0 applications) correctly implement these\n requirements:\n\n- Both clients and servers MUST support the Host request-header.\n\n- A client that sends an HTTP/1.1 request MUST send a Host header.\n\n- Servers MUST report a 400 (Bad Request) error if an HTTP/1.1\n request does not include a Host request-header.\n\n- Servers MUST accept absolute URIs.",

Persistent connections in HTTP/1.0 are\n explicitly negotiated as they are not the default behavior. HTTP/1.0\n experimental implementations of persistent connections are faulty,\n and the new facilities in HTTP/1.1 are designed to rectify these\n problems. The problem was that some existing 1.0 clients may be\n sending Keep-Alive to a proxy server that doesn't understand\n Connection, which would then erroneously forward it to the next\n inbound server, which would establish the Keep-Alive connection and\n result in a hung HTTP/1.0 proxy waiting for the close on the\n response. The result is that HTTP/1.0 clients must be prevented from\n using Keep-Alive when talking to proxies.\n\nHowever, talking to proxies is the most important use of persistent\n connections, so that prohibition is clearly unacceptable. Therefore,\n we need some other mechanism for indicating a persistent connection\n is desired, which is safe to use even when talking to an old proxy\n that ignores Connection. Persistent connections are the default for\n HTTP/1.1 messages; we introduce a new keyword (Connection: close) for\n declaring non-persistence. See section 14.10.\n\nThe original HTTP/1.0 form of persistent connections (the Connection:\n Keep-Alive and Keep-Alive header) is documented in RFC 2068. [33]\n\n19.6.3 Changes from RFC 2068\n\nThis specification has been carefully audited to correct and\n disambiguate key word usage; RFC 2068 had many problems in respect to\n the conventions laid out in RFC 2119 [34].\n\nClarified which error code should be used for inbound server failures\n (e.g. DNS failures). (Section 10.5.5).\n\nFielding, et al. Standards Track [Page 172]\n\f\nRFC 2616 HTTP/1.1 June 1999\n\nCREATE had a race that required an Etag be sent when a resource is\n first created. (Section 10.2.2).\n\nContent-Base was deleted from the specification: it was not\n implemented widely, and there is no simple, safe way to introduce it\n without a robust extension mechanism. In addition, it is used in a\n similar, but not identical fashion in MHTML [45].\n\nTransfer-coding and message lengths all interact in ways that\n required fixing exactly when chunked encoding is used (to allow for\n transfer encoding that may not be self delimiting); it was important\n to straighten out exactly how message lengths are computed. (Sections\n 3.6, 4.4, 7.2.2, 13.5.2, 14.13, 14.16)\n\nA content-coding of \"identity\" was introduced, to solve problems\n discovered in caching.

His pale grey eyes shone and\ntwinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire\nburnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the\nlilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our\nglasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather\nthan submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious\nafter-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the\ntrammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the\npoints with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his\nearnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.\n\n“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two\nideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,\nthey taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”\n\n“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said\nFilby, an argumentative person with red hair.\n\n“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground\nfor it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of\ncourse that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real\nexistence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.\nThese things are mere abstractions.”\n\n“That is all right,” said the Psychologist.\n\n“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a\nreal existence.”\n\n“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All\nreal things—”\n\n“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_ cube\nexist?”\n\n“Don’t follow you,” said Filby.",

All\nreal things—”\n\n“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_ cube\nexist?”\n\n“Don’t follow you,” said Filby.\n\n“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real\nexistence?”\n\nFilby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any\nreal body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have\nLength, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural\ninfirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we\nincline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three\nwhich we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,\nhowever, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former\nthree dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our\nconsciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter\nfrom the beginning to the end of our lives.”\n\n“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his\ncigar over the lamp; “that . . . very clear indeed.”\n\n“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,”\ncontinued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness.\n“Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some\npeople who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It\nis only another way of looking at Time. _There is no difference between\nTime and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our\nconsciousness moves along it_. But some foolish people have got hold of\nthe wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say\nabout this Fourth Dimension?”\n\n“_I_ have not,” said the Provincial Mayor.\n\n“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is\nspoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,\nBreadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three\nplanes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical\npeople have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularly—why not\nanother direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even\ntried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb\nwas expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month\nor so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two\ndimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and\nsimilarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could\nrepresent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the\nthing. See?”\n\n“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,\nhe lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who\nrepeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some\ntime, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\n\n“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry\nof Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For\ninstance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at\nfifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All\nthese are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional\nrepresentations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and\nunalterable thing.",

All\nthese are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional\nrepresentations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and\nunalterable thing.\n\n“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause\nrequired for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time\nis only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a\nweather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of\nthe barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then\nthis morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the\nmercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space\ngenerally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that\nline, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”\n\n“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if\nTime is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has\nit always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move\nin Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”\n\nThe Time Traveller smiled. “Are you so sure we can move freely in\nSpace? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,\nand men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions.\nBut how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”\n\n“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are balloons.”\n\n“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\ninequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”\n\n“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man.\n\n“Easier, far easier down than up.”\n\n“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the\npresent moment.”\n\n“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the\nwhole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present\nmoment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no\ndimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform\nvelocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_\nif we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”\n\n“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist. ’You\n_can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about\nin Time.”\n\n“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that\nwe cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an\nincident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I\nbecome absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course\nwe have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than\na savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a\ncivilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go\nup against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that\nultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the\nTime-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”\n\n“Oh, _this_,” began Filby, “is all—”\n\n“Why not?” said the Time Traveller.\n\n“It’s against reason,” said Filby.\n\n“What reason?” said the Time Traveller.",

Long\nago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”\n\n“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man.\n\n“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as\nthe driver determines.”\n\nFilby contented himself with laughter.\n\n“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller.\n\n“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologist\nsuggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of\nthe Battle of Hastings, for instance!”\n\n“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man.\n“Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”\n\n“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the\nVery Young Man thought.\n\n“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The\nGerman scholars have improved Greek so much.”\n\n“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man. “Just think! One\nmight invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and\nhurry on ahead!”\n\n“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic\nbasis.”\n\n“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist.\n\n“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”\n\n“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify _that_?”\n\n“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.\n\n“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s\nall humbug, you know.”\n\nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and\nwith his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of\nthe room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to\nhis laboratory.\n\nThe Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”\n\n“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby\ntried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he\nhad finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s\nanecdote collapsed.\n\nII.\n The Machine",

There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline\nsubstance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his\nexplanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He\ntook one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the\nroom, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug.\nOn this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat\ndown. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the\nbright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a\ndozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and\nseveral in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat\nin a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to\nbe almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat\nbehind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the\nProvincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the\nPsychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the\nPsychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me\nthat any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly\ndone, could have been played upon us under these conditions.\n\nThe Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. “Well?”\nsaid the Psychologist.\n\n“This little affair,” said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon\nthe table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, “is only\na model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will\nnotice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd\ntwinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way\nunreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger. “Also, here is one\nlittle white lever, and here is another.”\n\nThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.\n“It’s beautifully made,” he said.\n\n“It took two years to make,” retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we\nhad all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: “Now I want\nyou clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends\nthe machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the\nmotion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently\nI am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will\nvanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the\nthing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no\ntrickery. I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a\nquack.”",

I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a\nquack.”\n\nThere was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to\nspeak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth\nhis finger towards the lever. “No,” he said suddenly. “Lend me your\nhand.” And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual’s hand\nin his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the\nPsychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its\ninterminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain\nthere was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame\njumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little\nmachine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost\nfor a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory;\nand it was gone—vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.\n\nEveryone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.\n\nThe Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under\nthe table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. “Well?” he\nsaid, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he\nwent to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to\nfill his pipe.\n\nWe stared at each other. “Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you in\nearnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has\ntravelled into time?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the\nfire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist’s\nface. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped\nhimself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) “What is more, I have\na big machine nearly finished in there”—he indicated the\nlaboratory—“and when that is put together I mean to have a journey on\nmy own account.”\n\n“You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?” said\nFilby.\n\n“Into the future or the past—I don’t, for certain, know which.”\n\nAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. “It must have\ngone into the past if it has gone anywhere,” he said.\n\n“Why?” said the Time Traveller.\n\n“Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled\ninto the future it would still be here all this time, since it must\nhave travelled through this time.”\n\n“But,” said I, “If it travelled into the past it would have been\nvisible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we\nwere here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!”\n\n“Serious objections,” remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of\nimpartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.\n\n“Not a bit,” said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: “You\nthink. _You_ can explain that. It’s presentation below the threshold,\nyou know, diluted presentation.”",

It’s presentation below the threshold,\nyou know, diluted presentation.”\n\n“Of course,” said the Psychologist, and reassured us. “That’s a simple\npoint of psychology. I should have thought of it. It’s plain enough,\nand helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we\nappreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel\nspinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling\nthrough time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it\ngets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it\ncreates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it\nwould make if it were not travelling in time. That’s plain enough.” He\npassed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. “You\nsee?” he said, laughing.\n\nWe sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time\nTraveller asked us what we thought of it all.\n\n“It sounds plausible enough tonight,” said the Medical Man; “but wait\nuntil tomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.”\n\n“Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?” asked the Time\nTraveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way\ndown the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly\nthe flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of\nthe shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how\nthere in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little\nmechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of\nnickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of\nrock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted\ncrystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of\ndrawings, and I took one up for a better look at it. Quartz it seemed\nto be.\n\n“Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you perfectly serious? Or is\nthis a trick—like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?”\n\n“Upon that machine,” said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft,\n“I intend to explore time. Is that plain?

The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are\ntoo clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him;\nyou always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush,\nbehind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the\nmatter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown _him_ far\nless scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a\npork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more\nthan a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things\nthat would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his\nhands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who\ntook him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were\nsomehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was\nlike furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don’t think any of\nus said very much about time travelling in the interval between that\nThursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in\nmost of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical\nincredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter\nconfusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied\nwith the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the\nMedical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan. He said he had seen a\nsimilar thing at Tübingen, and laid considerable stress on the\nblowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not\nexplain.\n\nThe next Thursday I went again to Richmond—I suppose I was one of the\nTime Traveller’s most constant guests—and, arriving late, found four or\nfive men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was\nstanding before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his\nwatch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller, and—“It’s\nhalf-past seven now,” said the Medical Man. “I suppose we’d better have\ndinner?”\n\n“Where’s——?” said I, naming our host.\n\n“You’ve just come? It’s rather odd. He’s unavoidably detained. He asks\nme in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back. Says\nhe’ll explain when he comes.”\n\n“It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,” said the Editor of a\nwell-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.",

The other men were Blank, the Editor\naforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet, shy man with\na beard—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my observation went,\nnever opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at\nthe dinner-table about the Time Traveller’s absence, and I suggested\ntime travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that\nexplained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of\nthe “ingenious paradox and trick” we had witnessed that day week. He\nwas in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor\nopened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it\nfirst. “Hallo!” I said. “At last!” And the door opened wider, and the\nTime Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. “Good\nheavens! man, what’s the matter?” cried the Medical Man, who saw him\nnext. And the whole tableful turned towards the door.\n\nHe was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared\nwith green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to\nme greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually\nfaded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut\nhalf-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense\nsuffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been\ndazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just\nsuch a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in\nsilence, expecting him to speak.\n\nHe said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion\ntowards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it\ntowards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked\nround the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his\nface. “What on earth have you been up to, man?” said the Doctor. The\nTime Traveller did not seem to hear. “Don’t let me disturb you,” he\nsaid, with a certain faltering articulation. “I’m all right.” He\nstopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught.\n“That’s good,” he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came\ninto his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain\ndull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then\nhe spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. “I’m\ngoing to wash and dress, and then I’ll come down and explain things....\nSave me some of that mutton. I’m starving for a bit of meat.”\n\nHe looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he\nwas all right. The Editor began a question. “Tell you presently,” said\nthe Time Traveller. “I’m—funny! Be all right in a minute.”",

The Editor began a question. “Tell you presently,” said\nthe Time Traveller. “I’m—funny! Be all right in a minute.”\n\nHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I\nremarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and\nstanding up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing\non them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door\nclosed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he\ndetested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was\nwool-gathering. Then, “Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,” I\nheard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this\nbrought my attention back to the bright dinner-table.\n\n“What’s the game?” said the Journalist. “Has he been doing the Amateur\nCadger? I don’t follow.” I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my\nown interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time Traveller limping\npainfully upstairs. I don’t think anyone else had noticed his lameness.\n\nThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man,\nwho rang the bell—the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at\ndinner—for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and fork\nwith a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed.\nConversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of\nwonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. “Does our\nfriend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his\nNebuchadnezzar phases?” he inquired. “I feel assured it’s this business\nof the Time Machine,” I said, and took up the Psychologist’s account of\nour previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The\nEditor raised objections. “What _was_ this time travelling? A man\ncouldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?”\nAnd then, as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature.\nHadn’t they any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist too,\nwould not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the easy work\nof heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind of\njournalist—very joyous, irreverent young men. “Our Special\nCorrespondent in the Day after Tomorrow reports,” the Journalist was\nsaying—or rather shouting—when the Time Traveller came back. He was\ndressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look\nremained of the change that had startled me.\n\n“I say,” said the Editor hilariously, “these chaps here say you have\nbeen travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about little\nRosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?”\n\nThe Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word.\nHe smiled quietly, in his old way. “Where’s my mutton?” he said. “What\na treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!”\n\n“Story!” cried the Editor.",

I\nwon’t say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And\nthe salt.”\n\n“One word,” said I. “Have you been time travelling?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head.\n\n“I’d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,” said the Editor. The\nTime Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with\nhis fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his\nface, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner\nwas uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to\nmy lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist\ntried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The\nTime Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the\nappetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched\nthe Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even\nmore clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and\ndetermination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller\npushed his plate away, and looked round us. “I suppose I must\napologise,” he said. “I was simply starving. I’ve had a most amazing\ntime.” He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. “But come\ninto the smoking-room. It’s too long a story to tell over greasy\nplates.” And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the\nadjoining room.\n\n“You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?” he said\nto me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests.\n\n“But the thing’s a mere paradox,” said the Editor.\n\n“I can’t argue tonight. I don’t mind telling you the story, but I can’t\nargue. I will,” he went on, “tell you the story of what has happened to\nme, if you like, but you must refrain from interruptions. I want to\ntell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be it! It’s\ntrue—every word of it, all the same.

He sat\nback in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he\ngot more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much\nkeenness the inadequacy of pen and ink—and, above all, my own\ninadequacy—to express its quality.

Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the\nsmoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist\nand the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward were\nilluminated. At first we glanced now and again at each other. After a\ntime we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveller’s\nface.\n\nIV.\n Time Travelling\n\n“I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time\nMachine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the\nworkshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the\nivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s\nsound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when\nthe putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel\nbars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so\nthat the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten\no’clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career.

The laboratory got hazy and went dark.\nMrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards\nthe garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the\nplace, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I\npressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the\nturning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The\nlaboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow\nnight came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and\nfaster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb\nconfusedness descended on my mind.\n\n“I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time\ntravelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly\nlike that one has upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion! I\nfelt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I\nput on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The\ndim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me,\nand I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every\nminute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had\nbeen destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression\nof scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any\nmoving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast\nfor me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively\npainful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the\nmoon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a\nfaint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still\ngaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one\ncontinuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a\nsplendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun\nbecame a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter\nfluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and\nthen a brighter circle flickering in the blue.",

I was still on the hillside upon\nwhich this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and\ndim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown,\nnow green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge\nbuildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole\nsurface of the earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes.\nThe little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round\nfaster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and\ndown, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that\nconsequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the\nwhite snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by\nthe bright, brief green of spring.\n\n“The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They\nmerged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked,\nindeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to\naccount. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind\nof madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I\nscarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new\nsensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my\nmind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last\nthey took complete possession of me. What strange developments of\nhumanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation, I\nthought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim\nelusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and\nsplendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings\nof our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist.

And so my mind came round to the business of\nstopping.\n\n“The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance\nin the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled\nat a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered: I was, so to\nspeak, attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of\nintervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of\nmyself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant\nbringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle\nthat a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching\nexplosion—would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all\npossible dimensions—into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred to\nme again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had\ncheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man\nhas got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the\nsame cheerful light. The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute\nstrangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the\nmachine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely\nupset my nerves. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust\nof petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I\nlugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over,\nand I was flung headlong through the air.\n\n“There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been\nstunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was\nsitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still\nseemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was\ngone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a\ngarden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their\nmauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating\nof the hailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloud\nover the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I\nwas wet to the skin. ‘Fine hospitality,’ said I, ‘to a man who has\ntravelled innumerable years to see you.’\n\n“Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and\nlooked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white\nstone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy\ndownpour.

But all else of the world was invisible.\n\n“My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew\nthinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for\na silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in\nshape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being\ncarried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to\nhover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick\nwith verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless\neyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the\nlips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant\nsuggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space—half a\nminute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as\nthe hail drove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from\nit for a moment, and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and\nthat the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun.\n\n“I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity\nof my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy\ncurtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men?\nWhat if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in this\ninterval the race had lost its manliness, and had developed into\nsomething inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might\nseem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and\ndisgusting for our common likeness—a foul creature to be incontinently\nslain.\n\n“Already I saw other vast shapes—huge buildings with intricate parapets\nand tall columns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me\nthrough the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned\nfrantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As I\ndid so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The grey\ndownpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a\nghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint\nbrown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings\nabout me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the\nthunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled\nalong their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps\na bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will\nswoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth,\nand again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave\nunder my desperate onset and turned over.

I\nlooked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote\nfuture. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house,\nI saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, and\ntheir faces were directed towards me.\n\n“Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the\nWhite Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these\nemerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I\nstood with my machine. He was a slight creature—perhaps four feet\nhigh—clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt.\nSandals or buskins—I could not clearly distinguish which—were on his\nfeet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticing\nthat, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was.\n\n“He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but\nindescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful\nkind of consumptive—that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so\nmuch. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my\nhands from the machine.\n\nV.\n In the Golden Age\n\n“In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile\nthing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my\neyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at\nonce. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke\nto them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.\n\n“There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps\neight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them\naddressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too\nharsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears,\nshook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my\nhand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and\nshoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in\nthis at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty\nlittle people that inspired confidence—a graceful gentleness, a certain\nchildlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy\nmyself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins. But I made\na sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling\nat the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought\nof a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the\nmachine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and\nput these in my pocket.

Their hair,\nwhich was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek;\nthere was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears\nwere singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather\nthin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and\nmild; and—this may seem egotism on my part—I fancied even that there\nwas a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.\n\n“As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round\nme smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the\nconversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then,\nhesitating for a moment how to express Time, I pointed to the sun. At\nonce a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white\nfollowed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of\nthunder.\n\n“For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was\nplain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these\ncreatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me. You see, I\nhad always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and\nTwo Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art,\neverything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed\nhim to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old\nchildren—asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a\nthunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their\nclothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features. A flow of\ndisappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt that I had\nbuilt the Time Machine in vain.\n\n“I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of\na thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so and\nbowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful\nflowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was\nreceived with melodious applause; and presently they were all running\nto and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I\nwas almost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like can\nscarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of\nculture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should\nbe exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx\nof white marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while with a\nsmile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone.\nAs I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a\nprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible\nmerriment, to my mind.",

I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of\nlittle people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me\nshadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw over\ntheir heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long\nneglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of\nstrange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of\nthe waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegated\nshrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. The\nTime Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons.\n\n“The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not\nobserve the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions\nof old Phœnician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me that\nthey were very badly broken and weather-worn. Several more brightly\nclad people met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in\ndingy nineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded\nwith flowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright,\nsoft-coloured robes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of\nlaughter and laughing speech.\n\n“The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with\nbrown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with\ncoloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The\nfloor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not\nplates nor slabs—blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the\ngoing to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along\nthe more frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable\ntables made of slabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from\nthe floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognised as a\nkind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the most part they\nwere strange.\n\n“Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon\nthese my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise.\nWith a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with\ntheir hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round\nopenings in the sides of the tables.

And it caught my eye that the corner of the\nmarble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect\nwas extremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of\nhundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to\nme as they could come, were watching me with interest, their little\neyes shining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in the same\nsoft, and yet strong, silky material.\n\n“Fruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people of the remote\nfuture were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of\nsome carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found\nafterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the\nIchthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;\none, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was\nthere—a floury thing in a three-sided husk—was especially good, and I\nmade it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits,\nand by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to perceive their\nimport.\n\n“However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future\nnow. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to make\na resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine.\nClearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient\nthing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series of\ninterrogative sounds and gestures. I had some considerable difficulty\nin conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare of\nsurprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired\nlittle creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. They\nhad to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other,\nand my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their\nlanguage caused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement.\nHowever, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, and\npresently I had a score of noun substantives at least at my command;\nand then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb ‘to eat.’\nBut it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wanted to\nget away from my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity,\nto let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined.\nAnd very little doses I found they were before long, for I never met\npeople more indolent or more easily fatigued.\n\nVI.\n The Sunset of Mankind",

They would come to me with eager cries of\nastonishment, like children, but, like children they would soon stop\nexamining me, and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my\nconversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that almost\nall those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how\nspeedily I came to disregard these little people. I went out through\nthe portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was\nsatisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men of the future,\nwho would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, and,\nhaving smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to my\nown devices.\n\n“The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great\nhall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At\nfirst things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely different\nfrom the world I had known—even the flowers. The big building I had\nleft was situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames\nhad shifted, perhaps, a mile from its present position. I resolved to\nmount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a mile and a half away, from\nwhich I could get a wider view of this our planet in the year Eight\nHundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One, A.D. For that, I should\nexplain, was the date the little dials of my machine recorded.\n\n“As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly\nhelp to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the\nworld—for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for instance, was a\ngreat heap of granite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a vast\nlabyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps, amidst which were\nthick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants—nettles possibly—but\nwonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and incapable of\nstinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure,\nto what end built I could not determine. It was here that I was\ndestined, at a later date, to have a very strange experience—the first\nintimation of a still stranger discovery—but of that I will speak in\nits proper place.\n\n“Looking round, with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested\nfor a while, I realised that there were no small houses to be seen.\nApparently the single house, and possibly even the household, had\nvanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings,\nbut the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic features\nof our own English landscape, had disappeared.\n\n“‘Communism,’ said I to myself.",

I looked at the\nhalf-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash, I\nperceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft hairless\nvisage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange,\nperhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything was so\nstrange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all the\ndifferences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from\neach other, these people of the future were alike. And the children\nseemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents. I judged\nthen that the children of that time were extremely precocious,\nphysically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my\nopinion.\n\n“Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt\nthat this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would\nexpect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman, the\ninstitution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations are\nmere militant necessities of an age of physical force. Where population\nis balanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than\na blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring\nare secure, there is less necessity—indeed there is no necessity—for an\nefficient family, and the specialisation of the sexes with reference to\ntheir children’s needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even\nin our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I must\nremind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciate\nhow far it fell short of the reality.\n\n“While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a\npretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a\ntransitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed\nthe thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings towards\nthe top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently\nmiraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a\nstrange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.",

    "text": "my attention was attracted by a\npretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a\ntransitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed\nthe thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings towards\nthe top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently\nmiraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a\nstrange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.\n\n“There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognise,\ncorroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in\nsoft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of\ngriffins’ heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of our\nold world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and fair a\nview as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizon\nand the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of\npurple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in which the\nriver lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already spoken of the\ngreat palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruins\nand some still occupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figure\nin the waste garden of the earth, here and there came the sharp\nvertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There were no hedges, no signs\nof proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had\nbecome a garden.\n\n“So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had\nseen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was\nsomething in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a half\ntruth—or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)\n\n“It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane. The\nruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first\ntime I began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort in\nwhich we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is a\nlogical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security\nsets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions\nof life—the true civilising process that makes life more and more\nsecure—had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united\nhumanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are now mere\ndreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried\nforward. And the harvest was what I saw!",

One triumph of a united\nhumanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are now mere\ndreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried\nforward. And the harvest was what I saw!\n\n“After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in\nthe rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but a\nlittle department of the field of human disease, but, even so, it\nspreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our agriculture\nand horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate\nperhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number\nto fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favourite plants and\nanimals—and how few they are—gradually by selective breeding; now a new\nand better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger\nflower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them\ngradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our\nknowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our\nclumsy hands. Some day all this will be better organised, and still\nbetter. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The\nwhole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things\nwill move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In the\nend, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and\nvegetable life to suit our human needs.\n\n“This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done\nindeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine had\nleapt. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi;\neverywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant\nbutterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine\nwas attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of any\ncontagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell you\nlater that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been\nprofoundly affected by these changes.\n\n“Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in\nsplendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them\nengaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social nor\neconomical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all that\ncommerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It was\nnatural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of a\nsocial paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met,\nI guessed, and population had ceased to increase.",

It was\nnatural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of a\nsocial paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met,\nI guessed, and population had ceased to increase.\n\n“But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the\nchange. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the\ncause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:\nconditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and the\nweaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the loyal\nalliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and decision.\nAnd the institution of the family, and the emotions that arise therein,\nthe fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring, parental\nself-devotion, all found their justification and support in the\nimminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent dangers?\nThere is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against connubial\njealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion of all sorts;\nunnecessary things now, and things that make us uncomfortable, savage\nsurvivals, discords in a refined and pleasant life.\n\n“I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of\nintelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my\nbelief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes\nQuiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had\nused all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it\nlived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.\n\n“Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that\nrestless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness. Even\nin our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary to\nsurvival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and the\nlove of battle, for instance, are no great help—may even be\nhindrances—to a civilised man. And in a state of physical balance and\nsecurity, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out of\nplace. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war or\nsolitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to\nrequire strength of constitution, no need of toil. For such a life,\nwhat we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, are\nindeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they are, for the strong\nwould be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet. No doubt\nthe exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the outcome of the last\nsurgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled\ndown into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived—the\nflourish of that triumph which began the last great peace. This has\never been the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to\neroticism, and then come languor and decay.\n\n“Even this artistic impetus would at last die away—had almost died in\nthe Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in\nthe sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more.\nEven that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity. We are\nkept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity, and it seemed to me\nthat here was that hateful grindstone broken at last!",

We are\nkept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity, and it seemed to me\nthat here was that hateful grindstone broken at last!\n\n“As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simple\nexplanation I had mastered the problem of the world—mastered the whole\nsecret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they had devised\nfor the increase of population had succeeded too well, and their\nnumbers had rather diminished than kept stationary. That would account\nfor the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and plausible\nenough—as most wrong theories are!\n\nVII.\n A Sudden Shock\n\n“As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full\nmoon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in\nthe north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move about below, a\nnoiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the chill of the night. I\ndetermined to descend and find where I could sleep.\n\n“I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to the\nfigure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing\ndistinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see the\nsilver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes,\nblack in the pale light, and there was the little lawn. I looked at the\nlawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency. ‘No,’ said I stoutly\nto myself, ‘that was not the lawn.’\n\n“But it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was\ntowards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came home to\nme? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!\n\n“At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing\nmy own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The bare\nthought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip me\nat the throat and stop my breathing. In another moment I was in a\npassion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope.\nOnce I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching the\nblood, but jumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and\nchin. All the time I ran I was saying to myself: ‘They have moved it a\nlittle, pushed it under the bushes out of the way.’ Nevertheless, I ran\nwith all my might. All the time, with the certainty that sometimes\ncomes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knew\ninstinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath\ncame with pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill\ncrest to the little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am\nnot a young man. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in\nleaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and\nnone answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit\nworld.",

Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit\nworld.\n\n“When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realised. Not a trace of\nthe thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the empty\nspace among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it furiously, as if\nthe thing might be hidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, with\nmy hands clutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx, upon the\nbronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in the light of the rising\nmoon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay.\n\n“I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put\nthe mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of their\nphysical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed me: the\nsense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention my\ninvention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt assured: unless some\nother age had produced its exact duplicate, the machine could not have\nmoved in time. The attachment of the levers—I will show you the method\nlater—prevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when they\nwere removed. It had moved, and was hid, only in space. But then, where\ncould it be?\n\n“I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running violently\nin and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startling\nsome white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a small deer. I\nremember, too, late that night, beating the bushes with my clenched\nfist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs.\nThen, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I went down to the\ngreat building of stone. The big hall was dark, silent, and deserted. I\nslipped on the uneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables,\nalmost breaking my shin. I lit a match and went on past the dusty\ncurtains, of which I have told you.\n\n“There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon which,\nperhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I have no\ndoubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming suddenly\nout of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and\nflare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches. ‘Where is my\nTime Machine?’ I began, bawling like an angry child, laying hands upon\nthem and shaking them up together. It must have been very queer to\nthem. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. When I saw\nthem standing round me, it came into my head that I was doing as\nfoolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the\ncircumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear. For,\nreasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear must be\nforgotten.",

I heard cries of terror and their little feet\nrunning and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all I did as\nthe moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected nature of my\nloss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind—a\nstrange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro,\nscreaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horrible\nfatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of looking in this\nimpossible place and that; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching\nstrange creatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying on the ground\nnear the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness, even anger at\nthe folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength. I\nhad nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when I woke again it was\nfull day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf\nwithin reach of my arm.\n\n“I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had\ngot there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and\ndespair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable\ndaylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw the\nwild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself.\n‘Suppose the worst?’ I said. ‘Suppose the machine altogether\nlost—perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be calm and patient, to learn\nthe way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method of my loss,\nand the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the end,\nperhaps, I may make another.’ That would be my only hope, a poor hope,\nperhaps, but better than despair.

Still, I must be\ncalm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force or\ncunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about me,\nwondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and travel-soiled.\nThe freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness. I had\nexhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I found\nmyself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I made a careful\nexamination of the ground about the little lawn. I wasted some time in\nfutile questionings, conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the\nlittle people as came by. They all failed to understand my gestures;\nsome were simply stolid, some thought it was a jest and laughed at me.\nI had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty\nlaughing faces. It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of\nfear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage\nof my perplexity. The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped\nin it, about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of\nmy feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.\nThere were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints\nlike those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed my closer\nattention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze.\nIt was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep framed panels\non either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was hollow.\nExamining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with the\nframes. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if\nthey were doors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear\nenough to my mind.

But how it got there was a\ndifferent problem.\n\n“I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes\nand under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling\nto them, and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to the\nbronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my\nfirst gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I don’t know how to\nconvey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a grossly\nimproper gesture to a delicate-minded woman—it is how she would look.\nThey went off as if they had received the last possible insult. I tried\na sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same\nresult. Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you\nknow, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he\nturned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three\nstrides I was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe round\nthe neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the\nhorror and repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden I let him go.\n\n“But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels.\nI thought I heard something stir inside—to be explicit, I thought I\nheard a sound like a chuckle—but I must have been mistaken. Then I got\na big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flattened\na coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery\nflakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in\ngusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I\nsaw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last,\nhot and tired, I sat down to watch the place. But I was too restless to\nwatch long; I am too Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a\nproblem for years, but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours—that is\nanother matter.\n\n“I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes\ntowards the hill again. ‘Patience,’ said I to myself. ‘If you want your\nmachine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they mean to take\nyour machine away, it’s little good your wrecking their bronze panels,\nand if they don’t, you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it.\nTo sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is\nhopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this world. Learn its ways,\nwatch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the end\nyou will find clues to it all.’ Then suddenly the humour of the\nsituation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in\nstudy and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion of\nanxiety to get out of it. I had made myself the most complicated and\nthe most hopeless trap that ever a man devised. Although it was at my\nown expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud.",

I laughed aloud.\n\n“Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people\navoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had something to\ndo with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure\nof the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no concern and to\nabstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or two\nthings got back to the old footing. I made what progress I could in the\nlanguage, and in addition I pushed my explorations here and there.\nEither I missed some subtle point or their language was excessively\nsimple—almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs.\nThere seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, or little use of\nfigurative language. Their sentences were usually simple and of two\nwords, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest\npropositions. I determined to put the thought of my Time Machine and\nthe mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx, as much as possible\nin a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge would lead me back to\nthem in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand,\ntethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.\n\nVIII.\n Explanation\n\n“So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant\nrichness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same\nabundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and\nstyle, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same\nblossom-laden trees and tree ferns. Here and there water shone like\nsilver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and so\nfaded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presently\nattracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells,\nseveral, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. One lay by the path\nup the hill which I had followed during my first walk. Like the others,\nit was rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little\ncupola from the rain. Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering\ndown into the shafted darkness, I could see no gleam of water, nor\ncould I start any reflection with a lighted match. But in all of them I\nheard a certain sound: a thud—thud—thud, like the beating of some big\nengine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady\ncurrent of air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper\ninto the throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was\nat once sucked swiftly out of sight.",

Putting things together, I reached a strong\nsuggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose\ntrue import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to\nassociate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an\nobvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.\n\n“And here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and bells\nand modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in\nthis real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and coming times\nwhich I have read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, and\nsocial arrangements, and so forth. But while such details are easy\nenough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one’s\nimagination, they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid\nsuch realities as I found here. Conceive the tale of London which a\nnegro, fresh from Central Africa, would take back to his tribe! What\nwould he know of railway companies, of social movements, of telephone\nand telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal orders\nand the like? Yet we, at least, should be willing enough to explain\nthese things to him! And even of what he knew, how much could he make\nhis untravelled friend either apprehend or believe? Then, think how\nnarrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times, and\nhow wide the interval between myself and these of the Golden Age! I was\nsensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort;\nbut save for a general impression of automatic organisation, I fear I\ncan convey very little of the difference to your mind.\n\n“In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of\ncrematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me\nthat, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere\nbeyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I\ndeliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely\ndefeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make a\nfurther remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among\nthis people there were none.",

Yet\nI could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The several big\npalaces I had explored were mere living places, great dining-halls and\nsleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no appliances of any\nkind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at\ntimes need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly\ncomplex specimens of metalwork. Somehow such things must be made. And\nthe little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There\nwere no shops, no workshops, no sign of importations among them. They\nspent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in\nmaking love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I\ncould not see how things were kept going.\n\n“Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had\ntaken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. _Why?_ For the\nlife of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too, those\nflickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt—how shall I put it?\nSuppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and there in\nexcellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others made up of\nwords, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well, on the third\nday of my visit, that was how the world of Eight Hundred and Two\nThousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to me!\n\n“That day, too, I made a friend—of a sort. It happened that, as I was\nwatching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them\nwas seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main current\nran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer.\nIt will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these\ncreatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to\nrescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their\neyes. When I realised this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and,\nwading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her\nsafe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and\nI had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I\nhad got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any\ngratitude from her. In that, however, I was wrong.",

I\nhad got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any\ngratitude from her. In that, however, I was wrong.\n\n“This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman,\nas I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an\nexploration, and she received me with cries of delight and presented me\nwith a big garland of flowers—evidently made for me and me alone. The\nthing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate.\nAt any rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. We\nwere soon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in\nconversation, chiefly of smiles. The creature’s friendliness affected\nme exactly as a child’s might have done. We passed each other flowers,\nand she kissed my hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and\nfound that her name was Weena, which, though I don’t know what it\nmeant, somehow seemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a\nqueer friendship which lasted a week, and ended—as I will tell you!\n\n“She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She\ntried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it\nwent to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and\ncalling after me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world had\nto be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the future to\ncarry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her was\nvery great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic,\nand I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her\ndevotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. I\nthought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until\nit was too late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her\nwhen I left her. Nor until it was too late did I clearly understand\nwhat she was to me. For, by merely seeming fond of me, and showing in\nher weak, futile way that she cared for me, the little doll of a\ncreature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the White\nSphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I would watch for her\ntiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hill.\n\n“It was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left the\nworld. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest\nconfidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening\ngrimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded the\ndark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was the\none thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set\nme thinking and observing. I discovered then, among other things, that\nthese little people gathered into the great houses after dark, and\nslept in droves. To enter upon them without a light was to put them\ninto a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or one\nsleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a\nblockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of\nWeena’s distress, I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering\nmultitudes.",

But\nmy story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been the\nnight before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had been\nrestless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea\nanemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with a\nstart, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed\nout of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless\nand uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things are just\ncreeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut,\nand yet unreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out\nupon the flagstones in front of the palace. I thought I would make a\nvirtue of necessity, and see the sunrise.\n\n“The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of\ndawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black,\nthe ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up the\nhill I thought I could see ghosts. Three several times, as I scanned\nthe slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white,\nape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the\nruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They moved\nhastily. I did not see what became of them. It seemed that they\nvanished among the bushes. The dawn was still indistinct, you must\nunderstand. I was feeling that chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling\nyou may have known. I doubted my eyes.\n\n“As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on and\nits vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the\nview keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were mere\ncreatures of the half-light. ‘They must have been ghosts,’ I said; ‘I\nwonder whence they dated.’ For a queer notion of Grant Allen’s came\ninto my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts,\nhe argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them. On that\ntheory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred Thousand\nYears hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once. But the\njest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the\nmorning, until Weena’s rescue drove them out of my head. I associated\nthem in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my\nfirst passionate search for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasant\nsubstitute. Yet all the same, they were soon destined to take far\ndeadlier possession of my mind.",

I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun was\nhotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that the sun\nwill go on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar with\nsuch speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the\nplanets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As\nthese catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and\nit may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the\nreason, the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know\nit.\n\n“Well, one very hot morning—my fourth, I think—as I was seeking shelter\nfrom the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I\nslept and fed, there happened this strange thing. Clambering among\nthese heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose end and side\nwindows were blocked by fallen masses of stone. By contrast with the\nbrilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. I\nentered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spots\nof colour swim before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes,\nluminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watching me\nout of the darkness.\n\n“The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched my\nhands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to\nturn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity\nappeared to be living came to my mind. And then I remembered that\nstrange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to some extent, I\nadvanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh and\nill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once\nthe eyes darted sideways, and something white ran past me. I turned\nwith my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its\nhead held down in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space\nbehind me.

But, as I say, it went too\nfast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all\nfours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an instant’s\npause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find it\nat first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon one\nof those round well-like openings of which I have told you, half closed\nby a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this Thing have\nvanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw a\nsmall, white, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded me\nsteadfastly as it retreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a human\nspider! It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw for the first\ntime a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder\ndown the shaft. Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my\nhand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little\nmonster had disappeared.\n\n“I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for\nsome time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I\nhad seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that Man\nhad not remained one species, but had differentiated into two distinct\nanimals: that my graceful children of the Upper World were not the sole\ndescendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene,\nnocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir to all the\nages.\n\n“I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground\nventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And what, I\nwondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced\norganisation? How was it related to the indolent serenity of the\nbeautiful Overworlders? And what was hidden down there, at the foot of\nthat shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any\nrate, there was nothing to fear, and that there I must descend for the\nsolution of my difficulties. And withal I was absolutely afraid to go!\nAs I hesitated, two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in\ntheir amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow.

The male pursued\nthe female, flinging flowers at her as he ran.\n\n“They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned\npillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to\nremark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried to\nframe a question about it in their tongue, they were still more visibly\ndistressed and turned away. But they were interested by my matches, and\nI struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, and\nagain I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Weena,\nand see what I could get from her. But my mind was already in\nrevolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a\nnew adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these wells, to the\nventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of a\nhint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the Time\nMachine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution\nof the economic problem that had puzzled me.\n\n“Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was\nsubterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which made\nme think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a\nlong-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was the\nbleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark—the\nwhite fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes,\nwith that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of\nnocturnal things—witness the owl and the cat. And last of all, that\nevident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty yet fumbling awkward\nflight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of the head\nwhile in the light—all reinforced the theory of an extreme\nsensitiveness of the retina.\n\n“Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and\nthese tunnellings were the habitat of the New Race. The presence of\nventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes—everywhere, in fact,\nexcept along the river valley—showed how universal were its\nramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in this\nartificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of\nthe daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that I at once\naccepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this splitting of the\nhuman species. I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory;\nthough, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the\ntruth.",

I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory;\nthough, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the\ntruth.\n\n“At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear\nas daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely\ntemporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer\nwas the key to the whole position. No doubt it will seem grotesque\nenough to you—and wildly incredible!—and yet even now there are\nexisting circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to\nutilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes of\ncivilisation; there is the Metropolitan Railway in London, for\ninstance, there are new electric railways, there are subways, there are\nunderground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase and multiply.\nEvidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had\ngradually lost its birthright in the sky. I mean that it had gone\ndeeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories,\nspending a still-increasing amount of its time therein, till, in the\nend—! Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificial\nconditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the\nearth?\n\n“Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people—due, no doubt, to the\nincreasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf between\nthem and the rude violence of the poor—is already leading to the\nclosing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of\nthe land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country\nis shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf—which is due\nto the length and expense of the higher educational process and the\nincreased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the\npart of the rich—will make that exchange between class and class, that\npromotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of\nour species along lines of social stratification, less and less\nfrequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves,\npursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the\nHave-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of\ntheir labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have to pay\nrent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and\nif they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such\nof them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would\ndie; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would\nbecome as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as\nhappy in their way, as the Overworld people were to theirs. As it\nseemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed\nnaturally enough.",

It had been no such triumph of moral education and general\nco-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy,\narmed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the\nindustrial system of today. Its triumph had not been simply a triumph\nover Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man. This, I must\nwarn you, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in\nthe pattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely\nwrong. I still think it is the most plausible one. But even on this\nsupposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained must\nhave long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay.\nThe too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slow\nmovement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and\nintelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had\nhappened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect; but, from what I\nhad seen of the Morlocks—that, by the bye, was the name by which these\ncreatures were called—I could imagine that the modification of the\nhuman type was even far more profound than among the ‘Eloi,’ the\nbeautiful race that I already knew.\n\n“Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time\nMachine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the\nEloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And why\nwere they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said,\nto question Weena about this Underworld, but here again I was\ndisappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and\npresently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic\nwas unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she\nburst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, I ever saw\nin that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble about\nthe Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her\nhuman inheritance from Weena’s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and\nclapping her hands, while I solemnly burnt a match.\n\nIX.\n The Morlocks\n\n“It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow up\nthe new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a\npeculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the\nhalf-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in\nspirit in a zoological museum.

Probably my health was a little\ndisordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I\nhad a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite\nreason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the\nlittle people were sleeping in the moonlight—that night Weena was among\nthem—and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me even\nthen, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its\nlast quarter, and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of these\nunpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, this new vermin\nthat had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on both these\ndays I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. I\nfelt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldly\npenetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face the\nmystery. If only I had had a companion it would have been different.\nBut I was so horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness\nof the well appalled me. I don’t know if you will understand my\nfeeling, but I never felt quite safe at my back.\n\n“It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me\nfarther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the\nsouth-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe\nWood, I observed far-off, in the direction of nineteenth-century\nBanstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I had\nhitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I\nknew, and the façade had an Oriental look: the face of it having the\nlustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of a\ncertain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in aspect suggested\na difference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But the\nday was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after\na long and tiring circuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure for\nthe following day, and I returned to the welcome and the caresses of\nlittle Weena. But next morning I perceived clearly enough that my\ncuriosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of\nself-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an experience I\ndreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without further waste of\ntime, and started out in the early morning towards a well near the\nruins of granite and aluminium.",

She danced beside me to the well, but when\nshe saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely\ndisconcerted. ‘Good-bye, little Weena,’ I said, kissing her; and then\nputting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the climbing\nhooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for I feared my courage\nmight leak away! At first she watched me in amazement. Then she gave a\nmost piteous cry, and running to me, she began to pull at me with her\nlittle hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I\nshook her off, perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I was in\nthe throat of the well. I saw her agonised face over the parapet, and\nsmiled to reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks\nto which I clung.\n\n“I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The\ndescent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the\nsides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of a creature\nmuch smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily cramped and\nfatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of the bars bent\nsuddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into the blackness\nbeneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after that experience I\ndid not dare to rest again. Though my arms and back were presently\nacutely painful, I went on clambering down the sheer descent with as\nquick a motion as possible. Glancing upward, I saw the aperture, a\nsmall blue disc, in which a star was visible, while little Weena’s head\nshowed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machine\nbelow grew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disc\nabove was profoundly dark, and when I looked up again Weena had\ndisappeared.\n\n“I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up\nthe shaft again, and leave the Underworld alone. But even while I\nturned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with\nintense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a\nslender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the\naperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and\nrest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I\nwas trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the\nunbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air\nwas full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft.",

My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I\nwas trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the\nunbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air\nwas full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft.\n\n“I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching\nmy face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,\nhastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar to\nthe one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before\nthe light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me impenetrable\ndarkness, their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are\nthe pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected the light in the\nsame way. I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity,\nand they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light. But,\nso soon as I struck a match in order to see them, they fled\nincontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which\ntheir eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion.\n\n“I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently\ndifferent from that of the Overworld people; so that I was needs left\nto my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before exploration\nwas even then in my mind. But I said to myself, ‘You are in for it\nnow,’ and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of\nmachinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from me, and I\ncame to a large open space, and striking another match, saw that I had\nentered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into utter darkness\nbeyond the range of my light. The view I had of it was as much as one\ncould see in the burning of a match.\n\n“Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose\nout of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim\nspectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the bye, was\nvery stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly-shed blood\nwas in the air. Some way down the central vista was a little table of\nwhite metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any rate\nwere carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large\nanimal could have survived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all\nvery indistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene\nfigures lurking in the shadows, and only waiting for the darkness to\ncome at me again! Then the match burnt down, and stung my fingers, and\nfell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness.",

Then the match burnt down, and stung my fingers, and\nfell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness.\n\n“I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such an\nexperience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started\nwith the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly\nbe infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come\nwithout arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke—at times I\nmissed tobacco frightfully!—even without enough matches. If only I had\nthought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld\nin a second, and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there\nwith only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me\nwith—hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that still\nremained to me.\n\n“I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark,\nand it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my\nstore of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me until that\nmoment that there was any need to economise them, and I had wasted\nalmost half the box in astonishing the Overworlders, to whom fire was a\nnovelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark,\na hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was\nsensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the\nbreathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. I felt\nthe box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands\nbehind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures\nexamining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realisation of my\nignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very\nvividly in the darkness. I shouted at them as loudly as I could. They\nstarted away, and then I could feel them approaching me again. They\nclutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I\nshivered violently, and shouted again—rather discordantly. This time\nthey were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing\nnoise as they came back at me. I will confess I was horribly\nfrightened. I determined to strike another match and escape under the\nprotection of its glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a\nscrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow\ntunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and\nin the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among\nleaves, and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.",

I struck another\nlight, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how\nnauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale, chinless faces and great,\nlidless, pinkish-grey eyes!—as they stared in their blindness and\nbewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated\nagain, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had\nalmost burnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay\ndown on the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy.\nThen I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my\nfeet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I\nlit my last match … and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on\nthe climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from\nthe clutches of the Morlocks, and was speedily clambering up the shaft,\nwhile they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little\nwretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a\ntrophy.\n\n“That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty\nfeet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty\nin keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle against\nthis faintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the\nsensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth\nsomehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I\nfell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember\nWeena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of others among the\nEloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.\n\nX.\n When Night Came\n\n“Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto, except\nduring my night’s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a\nsustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was staggered by\nthese new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by\nthe childish simplicity of the little people, and by some unknown\nforces which I had only to understand to overcome; but there was an\naltogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocks—a\nsomething inhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I\nhad felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was\nwith the pit and how to get out of it. Now I felt like a beast in a\ntrap, whose enemy would come upon him soon.",

Now I felt like a beast in a\ntrap, whose enemy would come upon him soon.\n\n“The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new\nmoon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible\nremarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now such a very difficult\nproblem to guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was\non the wane: each night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I\nnow understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of\nthe little Upperworld people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul\nvillainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt\npretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upperworld\npeople might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks\ntheir mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two\nspecies that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down\ntowards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The\nEloi, like the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful\nfutility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the\nMorlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to\nfind the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made their\ngarments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs,\nperhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as\na standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals\nin sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on\nthe organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed.\nThe Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,\nthousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the\nease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back—changed!\nAlready the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were\nbecoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came into my head\nthe memory of the meat I had seen in the Underworld. It seemed odd how\nit floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my\nmeditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside. I tried\nto recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar,\nbut I could not tell what it was at the time.\n\n“Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their\nmysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this age\nof ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse\nand mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend myself.\nWithout further delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness\nwhere I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could face this\nstrange world with some of that confidence I had lost in realising to\nwhat creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt I could never sleep\nagain until my bed was secure from them. I shuddered with horror to\nthink how they must already have examined me.",

I felt I could never sleep\nagain until my bed was secure from them. I shuddered with horror to\nthink how they must already have examined me.\n\n“I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but\nfound nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the\nbuildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous\nclimbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the\ntall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam\nof its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena\nlike a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards the\nsouth-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but\nit must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a\nmoist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished. In addition,\nthe heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through\nthe sole—they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors—so that I\nwas lame. And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight of\nthe palace, silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky.\n\n“Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a\nwhile she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me,\noccasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my\npockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had\nconcluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floral\ndecoration. At least she utilised them for that purpose. And that\nreminds me! In changing my jacket I found…”\n\n_The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently\nplaced two withered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon\nthe little table. Then he resumed his narrative._\n\n“As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the\nhill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to\nthe house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the\nPalace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand\nthat we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. You know that great\npause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in\nthe trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that\nevening stillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few\nhorizontal bars far down in the sunset. Well, that night the\nexpectation took the colour of my fears. In that darkling calm my\nsenses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel\nthe hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see\nthrough it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and\nwaiting for the dark. In my excitement I fancied that they would\nreceive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war. And why\nhad they taken my Time Machine?",

And why\nhad they taken my Time Machine?\n\n“So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The\nclear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out.\nThe ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena’s fears and her fatigue\ngrew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed\nher. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck,\nand, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. So\nwe went down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I\nalmost walked into a little river. This I waded, and went up the\nopposite side of the valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a\nstatue—a Faun, or some such figure, _minus_ the head. Here too were\nacacias. So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet\nearly in the night, and the darker hours before the old moon rose were\nstill to come.\n\n“From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and\nblack before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either\nto the right or the left. Feeling tired—my feet, in particular, were\nvery sore—I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and\nsat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green\nPorcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked into the\nthickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide. Under that\ndense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. Even\nwere there no other lurking danger—a danger I did not care to let my\nimagination loose upon—there would still be all the roots to stumble\nover and the tree-boles to strike against. I was very tired, too, after\nthe excitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but\nwould pass the night upon the open hill.\n\n“Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in\nmy jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The\nhillside was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there\ncame now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars,\nfor the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly\ncomfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had gone from\nthe sky, however: that slow movement which is imperceptible in a\nhundred human lifetimes, had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar\ngroupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same\ntattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it)\nwas a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more\nsplendid than our own green Sirius. And amid all these scintillating\npoints of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the\nface of an old friend.",

And amid all these scintillating\npoints of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the\nface of an old friend.\n\n“Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the\ngravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable\ndistance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the\nunknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great\nprecessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty\ntimes had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that I\nhad traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity, all\nthe traditions, the complex organisations, the nations, languages,\nliteratures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knew him,\nhad been swept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who\nhad forgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went\nin terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the two\nspecies, and for the first time, with a sudden shiver, came the clear\nknowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Yet it was too\nhorrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white\nand starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought.\n\n“Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I\ncould, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs\nof the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very\nclear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then,\nas my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the\nreflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and\npeaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing\nit, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No\nMorlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that\nnight. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that\nmy fear had been unreasonable.

We found some fruit wherewith\nto break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and\ndancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as\nthe night. And then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen. I\nfelt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I\npitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly,\nat some time in the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks’ food had run\nshort. Possibly they had lived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now\nman is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he\nwas—far less than any monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is no\ndeep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men——! I tried to\nlook at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less\nhuman and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four\nthousand years ago. And the intelligence that would have made this\nstate of things a torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These\nEloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and\npreyed upon—probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena\ndancing at my side!\n\n“Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon\nme, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man\nhad been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his\nfellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the\nfullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I even tried a\nCarlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this\nattitude of mind was impossible. However great their intellectual\ndegradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim\nmy sympathy, and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and\ntheir Fear.\n\n“I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue.\nMy first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself\nsuch arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That necessity was\nimmediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so\nthat I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew,\nwould be more efficient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to\narrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the\nWhite Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had a persuasion that if\nI could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should\ndiscover the Time Machine and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks\nwere strong enough to move it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring\nwith me to our own time.

Only ragged vestiges of glass\nremained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had\nfallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon\na turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was\nsurprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged\nWandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then—though I\nnever followed up the thought—of what might have happened, or might be\nhappening, to the living things in the sea.\n\n“The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed\nporcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some\nunknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might help\nme to interpret this, but I only learnt that the bare idea of writing\nhad never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more\nhuman than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human.\n\n“Within the big valves of the door—which were open and broken—we found,\ninstead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows.\nAt the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was\nthick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was\nshrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange\nand gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower part of\na huge skeleton. I recognised by the oblique feet that it was some\nextinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and\nthe upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place,\nwhere rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing\nitself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton\nbarrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going\ntowards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and\nclearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of\nour own time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair\npreservation of some of their contents.\n\n“Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington!\nHere, apparently, was the Palæontological Section, and a very splendid\narray of fossils it must have been, though the inevitable process of\ndecay that had been staved off for a time, and had, through the\nextinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its\nforce, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness\nat work again upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of\nthe little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or\nthreaded in strings upon reeds. And the cases had in some instances\nbeen bodily removed—by the Morlocks, as I judged. The place was very\nsilent. The thick dust deadened our footsteps.

Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a\nlittle from my mind.\n\n“To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain\nhad a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palæontology; possibly\nhistorical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least in\nmy present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than\nthis spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another\nshort gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be\ndevoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind\nrunning on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no\nnitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the\nsulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the\nrest of the contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the\nbest preserved of all I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist\nin mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel\nto the first hall I had entered. Apparently this section had been\ndevoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out of\nrecognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once\nbeen stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held\nspirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for\nthat, because I should have been glad to trace the patient\nreadjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been\nattained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but\nsingularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle\nfrom the end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from\nthe ceiling—many of them cracked and smashed—which suggested that\noriginally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my\nelement, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big\nmachines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still\nfairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and\nI was inclined to linger among these; the more so as for the most part\nthey had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the vaguest\nguesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their\npuzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of\nuse against the Morlocks.",

I fancied that if I could solve their\npuzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of\nuse against the Morlocks.\n\n“Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she\nstartled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have\nnoticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may\nbe, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was\nbuilt into the side of a hill.—ED.] The end I had come in at was quite\nabove ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down\nthe length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last\nthere was a pit like the ‘area‘ of a London house before each, and only\na narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling\nabout the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the\ngradual diminution of the light, until Weena’s increasing apprehensions\ndrew my attention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a\nthick darkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that\nthe dust was less abundant and its surface less even. Further away\ntowards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small\nnarrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks\nrevived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic\nexamination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far\nadvanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge,\nand no means of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of\nthe gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had\nheard down the well.\n\n“I took Weena’s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her and\nturned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a\nsignal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever in my\nhands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted\nin the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of\nthe lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute’s strain, and\nI rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged,\nfor any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill\na Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing\none’s own descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any\nhumanity in the things. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a\npersuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my Time\nMachine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the\ngallery and killing the brutes I heard.",

The\nbrown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently\nrecognised as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since\ndropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left them. But here\nand there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the\ntale well enough. Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have\nmoralised upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing\nthat struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to\nwhich this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I\nwill confess that I thought chiefly of the _Philosophical Transactions_\nand my own seventeen papers upon physical optics.\n\n“Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a\ngallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of\nuseful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed,\nthis gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case.\nAnd at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of\nmatches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were\nnot even damp. I turned to Weena. ‘Dance,’ I cried to her in her own\ntongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we\nfeared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting\nof dust, to Weena’s huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of\ncomposite dance, whistling _The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I\ncould.

Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier\nsubstance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by\nchance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at\nfirst that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But\nthe odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this\nvolatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many\nthousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia painting I had once\nseen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perished\nand become fossilised millions of years ago. I was about to throw it\naway, but I remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good\nbright flame—was, in fact, an excellent candle—and I put it in my\npocket. I found no explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down\nthe bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I\nhad chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.\n\n“I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would\nrequire a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all\nthe proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms,\nand how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I\ncould not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised best against\nthe bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The\nmost were masses of rust, but many were of some new metal, and still\nfairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may once have been had\nrotted into dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps,\nI thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a\nvast array of idols—Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phœnician, every\ncountry on earth, I should think.

And here, yielding to an irresistible\nimpulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South\nAmerica that particularly took my fancy.\n\n“As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery\nafter gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes\nmere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I\nsuddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine, and then by the\nmerest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite\ncartridges! I shouted ‘Eureka!’ and smashed the case with joy. Then\ncame a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I\nmade my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waiting\nfive, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came. Of course\nthe things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence. I\nreally believe that had they not been so, I should have rushed off\nincontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my\nchances of finding the Time Machine, all together into non-existence.\n\n“It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within\nthe palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and\nrefreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position.\nNight was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still\nto be found. But that troubled me very little now. I had in my\npossession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against\nthe Morlocks—I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a\nblaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do\nwould be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. In the\nmorning there was the getting of the Time Machine.

I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next\nmorning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had\nstopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as far as\npossible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the\nprotection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any\nsticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such\nlitter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had anticipated,\nand besides Weena was tired. And I, also, began to suffer from\nsleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood.\nUpon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the\ndarkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity, that\nshould indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward. I had been\nwithout sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and\nirritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it.\n\n“While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against\ntheir blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and\nlong grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from their insidious\napproach. The forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across.\nIf we could get through it to the bare hillside, there, as it seemed to\nme, was an altogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my\nmatches and my camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminated\nthrough the woods. Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches\nwith my hands I should have to abandon my firewood; so, rather\nreluctantly, I put it down. And then it came into my head that I would\namaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the\natrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as an\ningenious move for covering our retreat.\n\n“I don’t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be\nin the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun’s heat is\nrarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as\nis sometimes the case in more tropical districts. Lightning may blast\nand blacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire. Decaying\nvegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation,\nbut this rarely results in flame.

I believe she would have\ncast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and\nin spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For\na little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking back presently,\nI could see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the\nblaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was\ncreeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again\nto the dark trees before me. It was very black, and Weena clung to me\nconvulsively, but there was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the\ndarkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was\nsimply black, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us\nhere and there. I lit none of my matches because I had no hand free.\nUpon my left arm I carried my little one, in my right hand I had my\niron bar.\n\n“For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,\nthe faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the\nthrob of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a\npattering behind me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more\ndistinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had heard\nin the Underworld. There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and\nthey were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at\nmy coat, then something at my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and\nbecame quite still.\n\n“It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so,\nand, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness\nabout my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar\ncooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping\nover my coat and back, touching even my neck. Then the match scratched\nand fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks\nin flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my\npocket, and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. Then\nI looked at Weena. She was lying clutching my feet and quite\nmotionless, with her face to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped\nto her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and\nflung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back\nthe Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her.

I put her carefully upon my shoulder and\nrose to push on, and then there came a horrible realisation. In\nmanœuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about several\ntimes, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my\npath. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of\nGreen Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly\nwhat to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I\nput Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily,\nas my first lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and\nleaves. Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks’ eyes\nshone like carbuncles.\n\n“The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,\ntwo white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.\nOne was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I\nfelt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of\ndismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of\ncamphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry\nwas some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time\nMachine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So, instead of casting\nabout among the trees for fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging\ndown branches. Very soon I had a choking smoky fire of green wood and\ndry sticks, and could economise my camphor. Then I turned to where\nWeena lay beside my iron mace.

Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air.\nMy fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I felt very\nweary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a\nslumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just to nod and\nopen my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon\nme. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for\nthe match-box, and—it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me\nagain. In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire\nhad gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest\nseemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by\nthe hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible\nin the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt\nas if I was in a monstrous spider’s web. I was overpowered, and went\ndown. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I\ndid so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I\nstruggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar\nshort, I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the\nsucculent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment I\nwas free.\n\n“The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting\ncame upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I determined\nto make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my back to a\ntree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was full of the\nstir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to\na higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none\ncame within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came\nhope. What if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that\ncame a strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly\nI began to see the Morlocks about me—three battered at my feet—and then\nI recognised, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running,\nin an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through\nthe wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.\nAs I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of\nstarlight between the branches, and vanish.

It\nwas my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for Weena, but\nshe was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud\nas each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection.\nMy iron bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks’ path. It was a\nclose race. Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I\nran that I was outflanked and had to strike off to the left. But at\nlast I emerged upon a small open space, and as I did so, a Morlock came\nblundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into the fire!\n\n“And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of\nall that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright as\nday with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or\ntumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm\nof the burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from it,\ncompletely encircling the space with a fence of fire. Upon the hillside\nwere some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and\nblundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment.\nAt first I did not realise their blindness, and struck furiously at\nthem with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing\none and crippling several more. But when I had watched the gestures of\none of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard\ntheir moans, I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in\nthe glare, and I struck no more of them.\n\n“Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting\nloose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one time\nthe flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would\npresently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the fight by\nkilling some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out\nagain brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill among\nthem and avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was\ngone.\n\n“At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this\nstrange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and\nmaking uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on\nthem. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through\nthe rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to\nanother universe, shone the little stars.

I\nbit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the\nground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here\nand there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and\ncalling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads\ndown in a kind of agony and rush into the flames. But, at last, above\nthe subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black\nsmoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing\nnumbers of these dim creatures, came the white light of the day.\n\n“I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was\nplain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot\ndescribe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate\nto which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved\nto begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I\ncontained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in\nthe forest. From its summit I could now make out through a haze of\nsmoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that I could get my\nbearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the remnant of these\ndamned souls still going hither and thither and moaning, as the day\ngrew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet and limped on across\nsmoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with\nfire, towards the hiding-place of the Time Machine.

Here was the same\nbeautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same splendid palaces\nand magnificent ruins, the same silver river running between its\nfertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and\nthither among the trees. Some were bathing in exactly the place where I\nhad saved Weena, and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. And\nlike blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the\nUnderworld. I understood now what all the beauty of the Overworld\npeople covered. Very pleasant was their day, as pleasant as the day of\nthe cattle in the field. Like the cattle, they knew of no enemies and\nprovided against no needs. And their end was the same.\n\n“I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had\nbeen. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly towards\ncomfort and ease, a balanced society with security and permanency as\nits watchword, it had attained its hopes—to come to this at last. Once,\nlife and property must have reached almost absolute safety. The rich\nhad been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his\nlife and work. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no\nunemployed problem, no social question left unsolved. And a great quiet\nhad followed.\n\n“It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is\nthe compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly\nin harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never\nappeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is\nno intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only\nthose animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety\nof needs and dangers.\n\n“So, as I see it, the Upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble\nprettiness, and the Underworld to mere mechanical industry. But that\nperfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical\nperfection—absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the feeding\nof an Underworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed.\nMother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years,\ncame back again, and she began below. The Underworld being in contact\nwith machinery, which, however perfect, still needs some little thought\noutside habit, had probably retained perforce rather more initiative,\nif less of every other human character, than the Upper. And when other\nmeat failed them, they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden.\nSo I say I saw it in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two\nThousand Seven Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as\nmortal wit could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and\nas that I give it to you.",

It may be as wrong an explanation as\nmortal wit could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and\nas that I give it to you.\n\n“After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and in\nspite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm\nsunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon my\ntheorising passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my own\nhint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and\nrefreshing sleep.\n\n“I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being\ncaught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on down\nthe hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one hand, and\nthe other hand played with the matches in my pocket.\n\n“And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal of\nthe sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid down into\ngrooves.\n\n“At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.\n\n“Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner of\nthis was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So\nhere, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the White\nSphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost sorry\nnot to use it.\n\n“A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal.\nFor once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks.\nSuppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the bronze\nframe and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it had been\ncarefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that the Morlocks\nhad even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to\ngrasp its purpose.\n\n“Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere touch\nof the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze\npanels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang. I was in the\ndark—trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I chuckled gleefully.\n\n“I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me.\nVery calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on the\nlevers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one little\nthing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the\nbox.\n\n“You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were close\nupon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at them\nwith the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine.\nThen came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had simply to fight\nagainst their persistent fingers for my levers, and at the same time\nfeel for the studs over which these fitted. One, indeed, they almost\ngot away from me. As it slipped from my hand, I had to butt in the dark\nwith my head—I could hear the Morlock’s skull ring—to recover it. It\nwas a nearer thing than the fight in the forest, I think, this last\nscramble.",

The darkness presently fell from my eyes. I found\nmyself in the same grey light and tumult I have already described.\n\nXIV.\n The Further Vision\n\n“I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with\ntime travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle,\nbut sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I clung\nto the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went,\nand when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to\nfind where I had arrived. One dial records days, and another thousands\nof days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions.\nNow, instead of reversing the levers, I had pulled them over so as to\ngo forward with them, and when I came to look at these indicators I\nfound that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds\nhand of a watch—into futurity.\n\n“As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things.\nThe palpitating greyness grew darker; then—though I was still\ntravelling with prodigious velocity—the blinking succession of day and\nnight, which was usually indicative of a slower pace, returned, and\ngrew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much at first. The\nalternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the\npassage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through\ncenturies. At last a steady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight\nonly broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky.\nThe band of light that had indicated the sun had long since\ndisappeared; for the sun had ceased to set—it simply rose and fell in\nthe west, and grew ever broader and more red. All trace of the moon had\nvanished. The circling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had\ngiven place to creeping points of light. At last, some time before I\nstopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless upon the\nhorizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then\nsuffering a momentary extinction. At one time it had for a little while\nglowed more brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen\nred heat. I perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting\nthat the work of the tidal drag was done. The earth had come to rest\nwith one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the\nearth. Very cautiously, for I remembered my former headlong fall, I\nbegan to reverse my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands\nuntil the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no\nlonger a mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines\nof a desolate beach grew visible.",

Still slower, until the dim outlines\nof a desolate beach grew visible.\n\n“I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round.\nThe sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out\nof the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars.\nOverhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it\ngrew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the\nhuge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a\nharsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I could see at\nfirst was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting\npoint on their south-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one\nsees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these\ngrow in a perpetual twilight.\n\n“The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to\nthe south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan\nsky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was\nstirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle\nbreathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living.\nAnd along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick\nincrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of\noppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast.\nThe sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and\nfrom that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now.\n\n“Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing\nlike a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky\nand, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of\nits voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly\nupon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what\nI had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me.\nThen I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you\nimagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving\nslowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antennæ, like\ncarters’ whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at\nyou on either side of its metallic front? Its back was corrugated and\nornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched\nit here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth\nflickering and feeling as it moved.",

I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth\nflickering and feeling as it moved.\n\n“As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a\ntickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to\nbrush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost\nimmediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught\nsomething threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a\nfrightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of\nanother monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were\nwriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with appetite, and\nits vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime, were descending\nupon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed a month\nbetween myself and these monsters. But I was still on the same beach,\nand I saw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them\nseemed to be crawling here and there, in the sombre light, among the\nfoliated sheets of intense green.\n\n“I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the\nworld. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea,\nthe stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the\nuniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air\nthat hurts one’s lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect. I moved\non a hundred years, and there was the same red sun—a little larger, a\nlittle duller—the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same\ncrowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and\nthe red rocks. And in the westward sky, I saw a curved pale line like a\nvast new moon.\n\n“So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a\nthousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth’s fate,\nwatching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in\nthe westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At last, more\nthan thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had\ncome to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I\nstopped once more, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared,\nand the red beach, save for its livid green liverworts and lichens,\nseemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with white. A bitter cold\nassailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down. To the\nnorth-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable\nsky, and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white.\nThere were fringes of ice along the sea margin, with drifting masses\nfarther out; but the main expanse of that salt ocean, all bloody under\nthe eternal sunset, was still unfrozen.",

A\ncertain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the\nmachine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green\nslime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A shallow\nsandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the\nbeach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank,\nbut it became motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye\nhad been deceived, and that the black object was merely a rock. The\nstars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very\nlittle.\n\n“Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had\nchanged; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this\ngrow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness\nthat was creeping over the day, and then I realised that an eclipse was\nbeginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the\nsun’s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is\nmuch to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of\nan inner planet passing very near to the earth.\n\n“The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts\nfrom the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in\nnumber. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond\nthese lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be hard to\nconvey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of\nsheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the\nbackground of our lives—all that was over. As the darkness thickened,\nthe eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the\ncold of the air more intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, one after\nthe other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into\nblackness. The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central\nshadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me. In another moment the pale\nstars alone were visible. All else was rayless obscurity. The sky was\nabsolutely black.",

I shivered, and\na deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared\nthe edge of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt\ngiddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and\nconfused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal—there was no\nmistake now that it was a moving thing—against the red water of the\nsea. It was a round thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may\nbe, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against\nthe weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then\nI felt I was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that\nremote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the\nsaddle.\n\nXV.\n The Time Traveller’s Return\n\n“So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the\nmachine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed,\nthe sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with greater\nfreedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed. The\nhands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again the dim shadows\nof houses, the evidences of decadent humanity. These, too, changed and\npassed, and others came. Presently, when the million dial was at zero,\nI slackened speed. I began to recognise our own pretty and familiar\narchitecture, the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the\nnight and day flapped slower and slower. Then the old walls of the\nlaboratory came round me. Very gently, now, I slowed the mechanism\ndown.\n\n“I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you\nthat when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs. Watchett\nhad walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me, like a\nrocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when she\ntraversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to be the\nexact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower end opened,\nand she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost, and\ndisappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered. Just\nbefore that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed like a\nflash.\n\n“Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar\nlaboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got off\nthe thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several minutes\nI trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was my old\nworkshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept there, and\nthe whole thing have been a dream.",

I might have slept there, and\nthe whole thing have been a dream.\n\n“And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner\nof the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the north-west, against\nthe wall where you saw it. That gives you the exact distance from my\nlittle lawn to the pedestal of the White Sphinx, into which the\nMorlocks had carried my machine.\n\n“For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through\nthe passage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and\nfeeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_ on the table by\nthe door. I found the date was indeed today, and looking at the\ntimepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o’clock. I heard your voices\nand the clatter of plates. I hesitated—I felt so sick and weak. Then I\nsniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the door on you. You know the\nrest. I washed, and dined, and now I am telling you the story.\n\nXVI.\n After the Story\n\n“I know,” he said, after a pause, “that all this will be absolutely\nincredible to you, but to me the one incredible thing is that I am here\ntonight in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and\ntelling you these strange adventures.” He looked at the Medical Man.\n“No. I cannot expect you to believe it. Take it as a lie—or a prophecy.\nSay I dreamed it in the workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon\nthe destinies of our race, until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my\nassertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest.\nAnd taking it as a story, what do you think of it?”\n\nHe took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap\nwith it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary\nstillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the\ncarpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller’s face, and looked round\nat his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of colour swam\nbefore them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of\nour host. The Editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar—the\nsixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The others, as far as I\nremember, were motionless.\n\nThe Editor stood up with a sigh. “What a pity it is you’re not a writer\nof stories!” he said, putting his hand on the Time Traveller’s\nshoulder.\n\n“You don’t believe it?”\n\n“Well——”\n\n“I thought not.”\n\nThe Time Traveller turned to us. “Where are the matches?” he said. He\nlit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. “To tell you the truth... I\nhardly believe it myself..... And yet...”\n\nHis eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon\nthe little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and I\nsaw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his knuckles.",

The Psychologist leant forward to see,\nholding out his hand for a specimen.\n\n“I’m hanged if it isn’t a quarter to one,” said the Journalist. “How\nshall we get home?”\n\n“Plenty of cabs at the station,” said the Psychologist.\n\n“It’s a curious thing,” said the Medical Man; “but I certainly don’t\nknow the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?”\n\nThe Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: “Certainly not.”\n\n“Where did you really get them?” said the Medical Man.\n\nThe Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who was\ntrying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. “They were put into my\npocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.” He stared round the room.\n“I’m damned if it isn’t all going. This room and you and the atmosphere\nof every day is too much for my memory. Did I ever make a Time Machine,\nor a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all only a dream? They say life\nis a dream, a precious poor dream at times—but I can’t stand another\nthat won’t fit. It’s madness. And where did the dream come from? … I\nmust look at that machine. If there is one!”\n\nHe caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the\ndoor into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light\nof the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a\nthing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid\nto the touch—for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it—and with\nbrown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon\nthe lower parts, and one rail bent awry.\n\nThe Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand\nalong the damaged rail. “It’s all right now,” he said. “The story I\ntold you was true. I’m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold.”\nHe took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we returned to the\nsmoking-room.\n\nHe came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat.\nThe Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation,\ntold him he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I\nremember him standing in the open doorway, bawling good-night.",

I\nremember him standing in the open doorway, bawling good-night.\n\nI shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a “gaudy lie.” For\nmy own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so\nfantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay\nawake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day\nand see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the laboratory,\nand being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory,\nhowever, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put\nout my hand and touched the lever. At that the squat\nsubstantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its\ninstability startled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of\nthe childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle. I came back\nthrough the corridor. The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He\nwas coming from the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a\nknapsack under the other. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an\nelbow to shake. “I’m frightfully busy,” said he, “with that thing in\nthere.”\n\n“But is it not some hoax?” I said. “Do you really travel through time?”\n\n“Really and truly I do.” And he looked frankly into my eyes. He\nhesitated. His eye wandered about the room. “I only want half an hour,”\nhe said. “I know why you came, and it’s awfully good of you. There’s\nsome magazines here. If you’ll stop to lunch I’ll prove you this time\ntravelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If you’ll forgive my\nleaving you now?”\n\nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,\nand he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the\nlaboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper.\nWhat was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded\nby an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson, the\npublisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely\nsave that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the\nTime Traveller.\n\nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly\ntruncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled\nround me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken\nglass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed\nto see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black\nand brass for a moment—a figure so transparent that the bench behind\nwith its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm\nvanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a\nsubsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A\npane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in.",

The Time Machine had gone. Save for a\nsubsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A\npane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in.\n\nI felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had\nhappened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange\nthing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,\nand the man-servant appeared.\n\nWe looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. “Has Mr. —— gone out\nthat way?” said I.\n\n“No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him\nhere.”\n\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed\non, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps\nstill stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring\nwith him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime.\nThe Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows\nnow, he has never returned.\n\nEpilogue\n\nOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he\nswept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy\nsavages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the\nCretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian\nbrutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now—if I may use the\nphrase—be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or\nbeside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age. Or did he go\nforward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still men, but\nwith the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems\nsolved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own part, cannot\nthink that these latter days of weak experiment, fragmentary theory,\nand mutual discord are indeed man’s culminating time! I say, for my own\npart. He, I know—for the question had been discussed among us long\nbefore the Time Machine was made—thought but cheerlessly of the\nAdvancement of Mankind, and saw in the growing pile of civilisation\nonly a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy\nits makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for us to live as\nthough it were not so. But to me the future is still black and blank—is\na vast ignorance, lit at a few casual places by the memory of his\nstory. And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange white\nflowers—shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle—to witness that\neven when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness\nstill lived on in the heart of man.\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TIME MACHINE ***\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\nbe renamed.",

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\n\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\n\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.
